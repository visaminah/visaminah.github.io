To maintain balance and a cozy vibe, add a grey-scale rug, or pillows in similar shades. A living room with a minimalist grey decor makes room for unique details and the motifs on the walls.’ - Source: Internet 20 of 21 Intensely Gray Living Room Walls Laura Moss Create an intimate living room or sitting area with a backdrop of steely gray. In this space, the walls and ceiling are the same color, which constructs a continual visual plane. Leaving the ceiling white would have made a jarring break where the saturated gray walls end and the ceiling begins. Light, soft neutrals give the space a comfortable aura, as do richly colored accents, such as the pillows and draperies. - Source: Internet 16 of 21 Cool Gray Tones Brie Williams Stormy blue-gray living room walls pair with a velvet sofa for a luxurious twist on traditional style. Silver and white accents keep the space light, and beige window treatments soften the look. A sisal rug adds nubby texture and an element of warmth. - Source: Internet This living room takes advantage of its long and narrow shape to keep itself feeling cozy and intimate. The rich navy blue walls and the whites of the built-in shelves, doors, baseboards, and ceiling go extremely well together. The long and low microsuede lounge couch as well as the playful colors of the striped central ottoman are good additions to the level loop floor carpeting and make the place feel personal and comfortable. - Source: Internet The dark blue used on the accent walls of this cottage living room is the perfect partner to the bright white paint used on the wainscot and door and window frames. Along with the glossy white painted wooden coffee table, the white upholstery on the sectional English couch is striking and goes with the theme of the area. Similarly, the throw cushions use block patterns of the same blue and white tones. The rich browns of the teak floor boards and the woven floor rug give this living room the warmth and coziness much needed in personal living spaces. - Source: Internet Today’s gray living room ideas are anything but gloomy. With shades that range from rich charcoal to wispy dove, gray is easy to effectively incorporate into spaces of any style. These gray living room ideas demonstrate how to use this contemporary neutral on walls, furniture, and decor. - Source: Internet Look for pastel greys with pebble or clay-like tones, and avoid harsher greys such as charcoal and graphite. These darker shades won’t contrast well against navy blue, and risk creating an overly negative or moody palette. Remember that the bedroom should feel like a welcoming space where you feel comfortable and relaxed, and a cold colour palette won’t help you achieve that feeling. - Source: Internet Navy and grey are two versatile colours which can complement each other beautifully, and they’re becoming an increasingly popular duo in bedroom colour schemes. ‘We see navy blue and grey colour schemes regularly in our community’, says Emily Chance from painting and decorating brand Harris Brushes (opens in new tab). ‘Both can work brilliantly with most other colours, and combine here to create a cosy aesthetic with a mature, adult edge – perfect for the bedroom.’ - Source: Internet Although orange and blue are contrasting colours, they work incredibly well together to bring a warm and vibrant lift to a room. One might consider pairing a navy sofa with a bold, tangerine footstool, or a scattering of orange cushions. However, it’s important to balance orange accents with other shades of blue, grey, black and white. - Source: Internet Pick out lampshades that give off a yellowish glow and always go for warm/soft white bulbs. Pick out different sources of light too. As with any living room, you’ll want to think about having a few different sources that all do different jobs. - Source: Internet We couldn’t not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best colors to pair with navy. It’s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it’s a mix that lends itself to any room and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that’s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - Source: Internet This modern living room design uses its blue accent wall to frame the picturesque views of the landscape outside, an effect that could be achieved by using such big glass windows. To contrast the brightness of the walls, it employs dark-stained hardwood floors with gloss that reflects the light coming in from the numerous windows. A white leather Lawson-style sectional sofa with playfully colored green and blue throw pillows, minimalist polished stone coffee and side tables, and a light tan shag carpet top off the modern, contemporary look. - Source: Internet 04 of 21 Airy Gray Decorating Ideas David A Land Chameleon-like gray tends to adapt to its environment. In this living room, shades of cloudy gray appear airy thanks to high ceilings that create a sense of spaciousness and large windows that allow plenty of light into the space. Different intensities of gray on walls, furniture, and window treatments play with bright pops of pink and teal for a colorful yet sophisticated effect. - Source: Internet The high vaulted ceilings is an eye-catching element of this design; the exposed trusses and ceiling cladding for this gable-roofed space are painted a bright white to contrast the rich navy blues of the walls. The carpet flooring, wainscot, and fireplace are also appropriately colored white. Wide windows of different varieties were used to provide picturesque vistas of the lake and forest in the background. The minimal use of furniture also gives the space sufficient spaciousness and flexibility. - Source: Internet Gone are the days when baby blue was the only way to go. Opt for smoked blue shades to achieve a grown-up look that’s soothing and chilled, but not cold. Balance pale blue walls with warm colours like burnt orange, terracotta, vintage peach and pink. Adding texture - velvet and faux fur - alongside vintage colour prints will soften the space even further, making it feel snug. - Source: Internet With a whimsical play on colors this blue and yellow themed contemporary living room makes a big personality statement. It’s hard not to want to have fun and hangout in such a bright and colorful environment. The large aqua blue sectional couch combines with blue artwork on the walls mixes well with the yellow accent wall and yellow retro tub chairs. - Source: Internet The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that’s meant to work. Complementary colors sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with blue, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn’t have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark blue. - Source: Internet This gallery features blue living room ideas from a variety of design styles. In these pictures you’ll find interior designs using the color blue in creative ways to create an inviting and attractive living space. Blue is used in paint color, decor, accents and furniture to create a serene and calming atmosphere in the home. - Source: Internet Tip: To make the room pop, you can also bring in some metallic (e.g., chrome or gold) details in the form of a coffee table or decorative vases. - Source: Internet A glint of warm metal will highlight a rich, navy sofa, especially one with velvet upholstery. Since metals are considered neutral, they can be worked into any colour scheme and are perfect for decorating around a navy blue sofa. Gold, brass and copper may also feature in Art Deco side tables, an opulent chandelier, vases and cushions. - Source: Internet 2 Pieces home decor signs This is Us Our Life Our Story Rustic Wood Signs Together Rustic Wooden Wall Art Signs Farmhouse Entryway Signs for Bedroom Living Room Decor, 4.7 x 13.8 Inch () - Source: Internet This contemporary piece of design is an eclectic example of using blue hues to define a space. The glossy saturated blue tone on the walls and wainscot keep the room feeling fresh and cozy. The dark oak floor boards also add warmth to the space. The centerpiece of the design, the stone and brick covered wood-burning fireplace, give the room a nice focal point that keeps the design grounded. Finally, the playful contemporary choices in seating – the geometrically patterned stools as well as the green leather accent chair – give the room some personality and life. - Source: Internet There are an assortment of blue living room ideas in this colorful room. This eclectic piece of design employs a color that has historically gone very well with blue: rose pink. The generous use of both hues can be seen all over the living room – in the charming camel back sofas and throw pillows, the microsuede club chair and upholstered arm chairs, and the brightly patterned blue and pink floor carpets. The arch-top french windows also add to the sophisticated and bright ambiance of the room. To top it all off, the intricate floral and leaf patterns on the blue wallpaper gives even more life to the space, keeping it stylish but also playful. - Source: Internet Like with most things in the world, we need balance and equilibrium in our homes too. So if you’re going to go for a dark grey living room – keep the floors light. Now, if you have wooden floorboards, you can either strip them back to a very light wood or try painting floorboards in a lighter, softer grey. - Source: Internet 11 of 21 Yellow and Gray Living Room Color Scheme Lauren Rubinstein Photography LLC Warm gray and citrus yellow are a fashion-inspired combo that can be an unexpected but fabulous addition to a living room. Brighten a cool gray space by bringing in bright yellow accents. Start with a foundation of gray furniture and yellow accessories, then add navy blue accents for a dynamic decorating scheme. Limit the amount of sunny yellow you add to keep the scheme fresh and bold. - Source: Internet 01 of 21 Monochromatic Gray Living Room James Nathan Schroder Go monochromatic to achieve a sophisticated, layered look. This gray living room combines a deep charcoal sofa with pewter window treatments and dove-gray walls. The various shades all work together because they have a similar undertone. Break up the neutral color scheme with creamy off-white and natural wood tones on accent furniture and accessories. - Source: Internet Like all dark colors, navy blue is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy blue walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a room. It’s also a lovely shade for warming up a navy blue color scheme as this steely blue living room demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - Source: Internet High ceilings in living room spaces keep an area feeling fresh and open. The use of a blue accent wall on the far end of this room as a contrast to the usage of beige and brown on the main walls helps break visual monotony but still maintains the harmony of the design elements in the space. The use of dark wooden floor boards, a subtle flushed wood-burning fireplace, a light mauve microsuede modern couch, and interesting rug patterns gives the space life and personality. - Source: Internet Blue on blue might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy blue furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich blue walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - Source: Internet 03 of 21 Barely There Gray Living Room Walls Edmund Barr Choose a barely-there shade of gray for living room walls to add dimension while preserving a light, airy look. In this neutral living room, a subtle gray wall color picks up the warm tones of the concrete floors. Natural materials, including wood accent furniture and a brown leather ottoman, lend this gray-and-white living room an organic feel. - Source: Internet Use soft warm greys and mix them with pastel decorating ideas for a pretty grey living room. Prevent it from feeling too sweet and sugary by accenting with darker, moodier shades seen here with black and white cushions and dark wood table. The result is a calm living room suitable for the whole family. - Source: Internet A more traditional approach was used for this blue living room design. It is worth noting the overall effect of using two shades of blues on the walls to really give the room some visual variety while still sticking to the thematic use of blue. The furniture pieces are simple but striking; hints of mid-century modern design can be seen in the three-seater sofa and white and brown striped accent arm chairs, while the sleek design of the glass and metal coffee table gives the room some much-appreciated edginess. The leaf-patterned center rug and the gray ash flooring keeps the space feeling homey and intimate. - Source: Internet Blue is often used to keep a place feeling new and refreshed. In this example, the brick fireplace and teak floor boards, in addition to the wide use of wooden side tables, give a cozy warmth that is also kept refreshing by the painted blue walls.The varied design styles of the furnishings and decors keep up that contrast of refreshing contemporary coupled with warm traditional design. - Source: Internet 18 of 21 Turquoise and Gray Living Room Anthony Masterson Shades of turquoise and blue on furniture, accents, and art take center stage in this neutral space. Light gray walls and a large expanse of windows provide a subtle backdrop. A white area rug further emphasizes the vibrant furniture, and a collection of accent pillows on the mushroom-tone sectional gives the gray living room texture and interest. - Source: Internet Navy walls offer a stylish contrast to any grey furniture, or decor pieces you might want to hang on them. According to decor expert Andrew Martin, ‘darker colours such as navy blue form a much better background for paintings and artworks than white or other neutral shades.’ - Source: Internet For personal-use spaces with high ceilings, it is good practice to segment the visual height by adding elements that break the height of the wall; this keeps the place feeling properly proportioned and appropriately intimate. In this example, there are two running sets of windows separated by a band of wall between them, as opposed to having one set of full-length windows. The dark blue of the box style ceiling also helps in keeping the ceiling from feeling too high up. The stone tile on the central wall houses the fireplace and main entertainment center. The gray carpet goes well with the modern and eclectic furniture choices seen in the Lawson-style sofa, floral-patterned club lounge chairs, and striped-patterned ottoman. - Source: Internet Repurpose your outdoor seating in an indoor space to get the most out of your purchase. We love this calming grey and white living room with shiplap walls and lots of indoor plants. Perfect for an all-year round botanical aesthetic. - Source: Internet 06 of 21 Gray Living Room Architecture David A. Land Keep the attention on interesting architectural elements by applying a neutral gray throughout the room. Stacked gray stone on the fireplace and a soft gray sofa let the large windows and soaring ceiling star in the space. Patterned throw pillows and contemporary artwork balance the room’s use of color. - Source: Internet This rooms accent wall, large patterned area rug, furniture pillows and curtains provide plenty of bright blue to lighten and energize this contemporary living room. The accent wall is the main focal point and is painted in a loch blue and surrounded by a stucco color paint. The light color flooring and large open sun-room help provide additional light to the space. - Source: Internet Pink and grey where the color power couple for a moment back there, but we are loving this new, more grown up take on it. Mixing a pale, cooler grey with a lovely warm blush pink creates an almost neutral space, especially if paired with white walls and wooden furnishings as seen here. Add in a touch of muted light blue to bring out the cooler tones of the grey. Very chic. - Source: Internet We all love on-trend colorful sofas but sometimes we want to keep it simple and uncomplicated. That’s where a grey sofa really comes into its own. It suits all styles of living room, from country cottage to industrial to contemporary, and anything in between. - Source: Internet Both being jewel-like tones, navy blue and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living room or bedroom. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy blue velvet furniture for a pairing that’s moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - Source: Internet ‘Display your black and white posters in a collage, and mix in oak frames to elegantly add wood details to the grey decor. Oak frames paired with other accessories, such as wooden side tables, brown leather pillows, and green plants, make a living room more lively while contributing an elegant balance.’ - Source: Internet A fluffy navy rug would be a warm addition to the room, and could be matched with cushions and blankets on the bed. Or, use these elements to bring a pop of colour to contrast with the blue and grey, such as a muted yellow or botanical green. Anything that makes the room feel more snug will work a charm. - Source: Internet Tropical themes appreciate the generous use of blue in their designs. In this example, the striking use of azure in the bamboo-frame arm chair, the saxony carpet, and the subtle back wall behind the built-in bookshelves serve as a good complement to the overall feel of the space. The white built-in shelving uses the books and knick-knacks it stores as intelligent accent pieces that keep the room feeling personalized and interesting. The chaise lounge sofas used go well the distressed wood finish on the coffee table and the aforementioned exotic feel of the bamboo-framed lounge chair. Finally, the wide french windows used do well in giving us a view of the lush greenery found outside. - Source: Internet ‘There are plenty of complementary color options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at colors such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark blue appear even deeper.’ says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - Source: Internet If you want to add some more grey tones to your living room, this is a really easy and effective way to do so. Rather than go all out painting a grey accent wall, instead learn how to paint window frames. See how in this space the two tones of grey help bring out the cooler tones of the blue and complements the pale wood of the floors and ceiling also. - Source: Internet ‘Display black and white photo prints in gold frames, and add pink as an accent in the grey interior. A pink pouffe, pink pillows, or a throw makes the perfect accessory and lends a softer side to your living room.’ - Source: Internet A selection of favorite nautical living room decor and interior design ideas.Nautical designer living rooms to inspire your own nautical living room decor.

And while blue and white is the most classic and popular nautical decor style, there are some designer interiors that show examples of neutral nautical living room designs using pastel blue and sandy beige. - Source: Internet Due to its connotations of wealth and luxury – historically it was the most expensive colour to produce - you’ll often see classic blue in bold, traditional interior schemes. But, don’t forget that this shade has its origins in nature, so it holds a firm place in boho design. It is the colour of the dark night sky, after all. - Source: Internet 13 of 21 Slate Gray Living Room Walls John Merkl These dark slate gray walls are anything but dreary, especially with the help of bright white trim and open shelves. A warm brown rug tops golden wood floors to prevent the small living room from feeling cold. Small hints of hot pink add modern color and foster a glam look. - Source: Internet If you can’t decide between a beige room or a grey one, it’s actually a perfect warm-toned color that combines the two hues. We love how it’s been styled in this living room with splashes of sage green and pale mustard yellow. So what is the perfect greige shade? Well, we recommend Farrow and Ball (opens in new tab) Stony Ground. - Source: Internet The navy walls and hardwood floors of this living room design go exceedingly well with the olive green mid-century modern sofas and floral patterns seen all over the room – in the curtains of the french windows, in the throw cushions of the couches, and in the central floor rug used. The red leather tufted ottoman is the center piece of this living room design, its bold, rich velvet red contrasting with the greens and blues of the rest of the space. This living room, with its selection of design elements and contrast, feels alive and stylish. - Source: Internet 14 of 21 Gray Living Room Accents Ryann Ford A dark gray sofa becomes the focal point of this largely white and tan space.

Here, the couch’s gray tones are echoed in the stone fireplace surround and a small side table, while a nubby brown rug and green pillows round out the nature-inspired color palette. This neutral works well with all colors and wood tones, making it a lovely alternative to beige. - Source: Internet Marianne from Dulux agrees. ‘It’s especially important to choose ‘warm’ versions of grey to pair with navy, as combining two ‘cool’ colours could easily make a room feel less cosy than you might have wished.’ - Source: Internet If you’re looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear.

We’ve rounded up some of our favorite hues to pair with navy, and some of them definitely aren’t what you were expecting. Whether you opt for a traditional pairing or go for something unexpected and bold, navy blue comes through again and again. Which is probably why it’s earned itself a spot in the pantheon to begin with. - Source: Internet Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it’s likely to be the color of the year 2023. It’s a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy blue. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - Source: Internet 12 of 21 Decorating with Shades of Gray Kim Cornelison This gray-and-white living room marries different shades of gray with varying undertones. The stone around the fireplace features purple undertones, while the light gray walls incorporate warm shades of beige. Gold accents and bright throw pillows warm up a charcoal sofa. A large fiddle-leaf fig plant adds a natural touch. - Source: Internet Warm grey hues however will nicely complement navy and create a more comforting atmosphere. ‘We recommend a warmer grey shade to avoid making your colour palette appear moody and negative’, says Emily from Harris Brushes. ‘Try something like Dulux (opens in new tab)’s Dieskau, Warm Pewter, or Timeless Grey, to leave room for your navy to work wonders.’ - Source: Internet ‘Colour blocking has become the new feature wall over the last couple of years, because it adds interest in a really simple way and all you need is some paint and some masking tape’, says Aaron Markwell, Colour Expert at COAT (opens in new tab). ‘Paint the ceiling and the top half of the wall the same light grey, to reduce visual noise in the room. Then paint the bottom half of the wall in your navy.’ - Source: Internet This traditional living room was tastefully and carefully designed to achieve a classic and sophisticated feel. The dark hues of the blue paint on the walls was an intelligent choice to keep the room feeling rightfully elegant; the whites of the leather English sofas, stone fireplace, cove ceiling, baseboards, and window frames keep the place from feeling too dark. The rich dark stain on the oak flooring and the subtle use of solid wood furniture also add to the warmth of the area. Lastly, the use of a glass coffee table and the contemporary glass chandelier further adds style to the room. - Source: Internet If you want to add a touch of luxury to a grey living room, velvet is the way to do it. The obvious choice is to go for a gorgeous grey velvet sofa, that will be the focus of your space. Opt for a deep charcoal – practical and pretty. - Source: Internet We actually did had a recent debate over is grey still in style? And the overwhelming majority said yes. Thank god, because it’s our personal fave color to decorate with and we think it works in every room of the home. There is however a trend towards much warmer greigey greys recently, so consider choosing a grey that has a more earthy undertone. - Source: Internet 05 of 21 Dark Gray Living Room Walls Tria Giovan Use gray to define your style and make personal collections stand out. Deep gray living room walls bring sophistication and warmth to this space. Here, the dark neutral provides the perfect backdrop for sculptural chairs, antique art, and vintage collectibles. The white ceiling and trim, as well as a large off-white area rug, brighten the space. - Source: Internet Navy blue and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out. The muted warm rosy tones of blush pink counteract any of the cooler tones of the deep blue and the navy prevents the pink from looking too sweet and sickly. - Source: Internet 02 of 21 Gray Living Room Furniture Dana Gallagher Although gray has a distinct presence in living room color schemes, it’s still considered neutral. Consider applying gray living room ideas to big-ticket items, such as furniture and flooring, that aren’t as easily or affordably changed.

To maintain balance and a cozy vibe, add a grey-scale rug, or pillows in similar shades. A living <strong>room</strong> with a minimalist grey decor makes <strong>room</strong> for unique details and the motifs on the walls.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>20 of 21 Intensely Gray Living Room Walls Laura Moss Create an intimate living <strong>room</strong> or sitting area with a backdrop of steely gray. In this space, the walls and ceiling are the same color, which constructs a continual visual plane. Leaving the ceiling white would have made a jarring break where the saturated gray walls end and the ceiling begins. Light, soft neutrals give the space a comfortable aura, as do richly colored accents, such as the pillows and draperies. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>16 of 21 Cool Gray Tones Brie Williams Stormy <strong>blue</strong>-gray living <strong>room</strong> walls pair with a velvet sofa for a luxurious twist on traditional style. Silver and white accents keep the space light, and beige window treatments soften the look. A sisal rug adds nubby texture and an element of warmth. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This living <strong>room</strong> takes advantage of its long and narrow shape to keep itself feeling cozy and intimate. The rich navy <strong>blue</strong> walls and the whites of the built-in shelves, doors, baseboards, and ceiling go extremely well together. The long and low microsuede lounge couch as well as the playful colors of the striped central ottoman are good additions to the level loop floor carpeting and make the place feel personal and comfortable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The dark <strong>blue</strong> used on the accent walls of this cottage living <strong>room</strong> is the perfect partner to the bright white paint used on the wainscot and door and window frames. Along with the glossy white painted wooden coffee table, the white upholstery on the sectional English couch is striking and goes with the theme of the area. Similarly, the throw cushions use block patterns of the same <strong>blue</strong> and white tones. The rich browns of the teak floor boards and the woven floor rug give this living <strong>room</strong> the warmth and coziness much needed in personal living spaces. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Today&rsquo;s gray living <strong>room</strong> ideas are anything but gloomy. With shades that range from rich charcoal to wispy dove, gray is easy to effectively incorporate into spaces of any style. These gray living <strong>room</strong> ideas demonstrate how to use this contemporary neutral on walls, furniture, and decor. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Look for pastel greys with pebble or clay-like tones, and avoid harsher greys such as charcoal and graphite. These darker shades won&rsquo;t contrast well against navy <strong>blue</strong>, and risk creating an overly negative or moody palette. Remember that the bed<strong>room</strong> should feel like a welcoming space where you feel comfortable and relaxed, and a cold colour palette won&rsquo;t help you achieve that feeling. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy and grey are two versatile colours which can complement each other beautifully, and they&rsquo;re becoming an increasingly popular duo in bed<strong>room</strong> colour schemes. &lsquo;We see navy <strong>blue</strong> and grey colour schemes regularly in our community&rsquo;, says Emily Chance from painting and decorating brand Harris Brushes (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Both can work brilliantly with most other colours, and combine here to create a cosy aesthetic with a mature, adult edge – perfect for the bed<strong>room</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Although orange and <strong>blue</strong> are contrasting colours, they work incredibly well together to bring a warm and vibrant lift to a <strong>room</strong>. One might consider pairing a navy sofa with a bold, tangerine footstool, or a scattering of orange cushions. However, it’s important to balance orange accents with other shades of <strong>blue</strong>, grey, black and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pick out lampshades that give off a yellowish glow and always go for warm/soft white bulbs. Pick out different sources of light too. As with any living <strong>room</strong>, you&rsquo;ll want to think about having a few different sources that all do different jobs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We couldn&rsquo;t not have a crisp white right up there as one of the best colors to pair with navy. It&rsquo;s the oldest, most tried combination and we will never tire of it. Classic, clean, and crisp it&rsquo;s a mix that lends itself to any <strong>room</strong> and any style, but it works particularly well in kitchens for a look that&rsquo;s bold and yet timeless. Consider opting for a two-tone look, mixing dark navy cabinets with a true white island. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This modern living <strong>room</strong> design uses its <strong>blue</strong> accent wall to frame the picturesque views of the landscape outside, an effect that could be achieved by using such big glass windows. To contrast the brightness of the walls, it employs dark-stained hardwood floors with gloss that reflects the light coming in from the numerous windows. A white leather Lawson-style sectional sofa with playfully colored green and <strong>blue</strong> throw pillows, minimalist polished stone coffee and side tables, and a light tan shag carpet top off the modern, contemporary look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>04 of 21 Airy Gray Decorating Ideas David A Land Chameleon-like gray tends to adapt to its environment. In this living <strong>room</strong>, shades of cloudy gray appear airy thanks to high ceilings that create a sense of spaciousness and large windows that allow plenty of light into the space. Different intensities of gray on walls, furniture, and window treatments play with bright pops of pink and teal for a colorful yet sophisticated effect. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The high vaulted ceilings is an eye-catching element of this design; the exposed trusses and ceiling cladding for this gable-roofed space are painted a bright white to contrast the rich navy <strong>blue</strong>s of the walls. The carpet flooring, wainscot, and fireplace are also appropriately colored white. Wide windows of different varieties were used to provide picturesque vistas of the lake and forest in the background. The minimal use of furniture also gives the space sufficient spaciousness and flexibility. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Gone are the days when baby <strong>blue</strong> was the only way to go. Opt for smoked <strong>blue</strong> shades to achieve a grown-up look that’s soothing and chilled, but not cold. Balance pale <strong>blue</strong> walls with warm colours like burnt orange, terracotta, vintage peach and pink. Adding texture - velvet and faux fur - alongside vintage colour prints will soften the space even further, making it feel snug. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With a whimsical play on colors this <strong>blue</strong> and yellow themed contemporary living <strong>room</strong> makes a big personality statement. It’s hard not to want to have fun and hangout in such a bright and colorful environment. The large aqua <strong>blue</strong> sectional couch combines with <strong>blue</strong> artwork on the walls mixes well with the yellow accent wall and yellow retro tub chairs. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The color wheel already tells us this is a combination that&rsquo;s meant to work. Complementary colors sit opposite each other so orange was made to pair with <strong>blue</strong>, the warmth balancing out the cool of the navy. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a dramatic high-contrasting scheme (although we do love how tangerines really zing against navy), a deep rusty orange looks beautiful against the moodier tones of a dark <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This gallery features <strong>blue</strong> living <strong>room</strong> ideas from a variety of design styles. In these pictures you’ll find interior designs using the color <strong>blue</strong> in creative ways to create an inviting and attractive living space.

Since metals are considered neutral, they can be worked into any colour scheme and are perfect for decorating around a navy <strong>blue</strong> sofa. Gold, brass and copper may also feature in Art Deco side tables, an opulent chandelier, vases and cushions. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>2 Pieces home decor signs This is Us Our Life Our Story Rustic Wood Signs Together Rustic Wooden Wall Art Signs Farmhouse Entryway Signs for Bed<strong>room</strong> Living Room Decor, 4.7 x 13.8 Inch () - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This contemporary piece of design is an eclectic example of using <strong>blue</strong> hues to define a space. The glossy saturated <strong>blue</strong> tone on the walls and wainscot keep the <strong>room</strong> feeling fresh and cozy. The dark oak floor boards also add warmth to the space. The centerpiece of the design, the stone and brick covered wood-burning fireplace, give the <strong>room</strong> a nice focal point that keeps the design grounded.

The generous use of both hues can be seen all over the living <strong>room</strong> – in the charming camel back sofas and throw pillows, the microsuede club chair and upholstered arm chairs, and the brightly patterned <strong>blue</strong> and pink floor carpets. The arch-top french windows also add to the sophisticated and bright ambiance of the <strong>room</strong>. To top it all off, the intricate floral and leaf patterns on the <strong>blue</strong> wallpaper gives even more life to the space, keeping it stylish but also playful. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like with most things in the world, we need balance and equilibrium in our homes too. So if you&rsquo;re going to go for a dark grey living <strong>room</strong> – keep the floors light.

Brighten a cool gray space by bringing in bright yellow accents. Start with a foundation of gray furniture and yellow accessories, then add navy <strong>blue</strong> accents for a dynamic decorating scheme. Limit the amount of sunny yellow you add to keep the scheme fresh and bold. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>01 of 21 Monochromatic Gray Living Room James Nathan Schroder Go monochromatic to achieve a sophisticated, layered look. This gray living <strong>room</strong> combines a deep charcoal sofa with pewter window treatments and dove-gray walls. The various shades all work together because they have a similar undertone. Break up the neutral color scheme with creamy off-white and natural wood tones on accent furniture and accessories. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Like all dark colors, navy <strong>blue</strong> is the perfect backdrop for making bright bold hues really pop. A sunny mustard yellow stands out so vividly against navy <strong>blue</strong> walls even just a splash of it becomes the focal point in a <strong>room</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a lovely shade for warming up a navy <strong>blue</strong> color scheme as this steely <strong>blue</strong> living <strong>room</strong> demonstrates – the dark walls and cool grey sofa need that accent of something warmer to make this space feel more inviting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>High ceilings in living <strong>room</strong> spaces keep an area feeling fresh and open. The use of a <strong>blue</strong> accent wall on the far end of this <strong>room</strong> as a contrast to the usage of beige and brown on the main walls helps break visual monotony but still maintains the harmony of the design elements in the space. The use of dark wooden floor boards, a subtle flushed wood-burning fireplace, a light mauve microsuede modern couch, and interesting rug patterns gives the space life and personality. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue on <strong>blue</strong> might sound bland, but going all over with a single color always has a surprisingly striking effect. Trying pairing navy <strong>blue</strong> furniture, whether that be a sofa or a headboard, with slightly lighter rich <strong>blue</strong> walls for a calming and cocooning look. Add some much-needed warmth with gold accents as can be seen here with the mirror and the lighting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 21 Barely There Gray Living Room Walls Edmund Barr Choose a barely-there shade of gray for living <strong>room</strong> walls to add dimension while preserving a light, airy look. In this neutral living <strong>room</strong>, a subtle gray wall color picks up the warm tones of the concrete floors. Natural materials, including wood accent furniture and a brown leather ottoman, lend this gray-and-white living <strong>room</strong> an organic feel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use soft warm greys and mix them with pastel decorating ideas for a pretty grey living <strong>room</strong>. Prevent it from feeling too sweet and sugary by accenting with darker, moodier shades seen here with black and white cushions and dark wood table. The result is a calm living <strong>room</strong> suitable for the whole family. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A more traditional approach was used for this <strong>blue</strong> living <strong>room</strong> design. It is worth noting the overall effect of using two shades of <strong>blue</strong>s on the walls to really give the <strong>room</strong> some visual variety while still sticking to the thematic use of <strong>blue</strong>. The furniture pieces are simple but striking; hints of mid-century modern design can be seen in the three-seater sofa and white and brown striped accent arm chairs, while the sleek design of the glass and metal coffee table gives the <strong>room</strong> some much-appreciated edginess. The leaf-patterned center rug and the gray ash flooring keeps the space feeling homey and intimate. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue is often used to keep a place feeling new and refreshed. In this example, the brick fireplace and teak floor boards, in addition to the wide use of wooden side tables, give a cozy warmth that is also kept refreshing by the painted <strong>blue</strong> walls.The varied design styles of the furnishings and decors keep up that contrast of refreshing contemporary coupled with warm traditional design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>18 of 21 Turquoise and Gray Living Room Anthony Masterson Shades of turquoise and <strong>blue</strong> on furniture, accents, and art take center stage in this neutral space. Light gray walls and a large expanse of windows provide a subtle backdrop. A white area rug further emphasizes the vibrant furniture, and a collection of accent pillows on the mush<strong>room</strong>-tone sectional gives the gray living <strong>room</strong> texture and interest. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy walls offer a stylish contrast to any grey furniture, or decor pieces you might want to hang on them. According to decor expert Andrew Martin, &lsquo;darker colours such as navy <strong>blue</strong> form a much better background for paintings and artworks than white or other neutral shades.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>For personal-use spaces with high ceilings, it is good practice to segment the visual height by adding elements that break the height of the wall; this keeps the place feeling properly proportioned and appropriately intimate. In this example, there are two running sets of windows separated by a band of wall between them, as opposed to having one set of full-length windows. The dark <strong>blue</strong> of the box style ceiling also helps in keeping the ceiling from feeling too high up. The stone tile on the central wall houses the fireplace and main entertainment center. The gray carpet goes well with the modern and eclectic furniture choices seen in the Lawson-style sofa, floral-patterned club lounge chairs, and striped-patterned ottoman. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Repurpose your outdoor seating in an indoor space to get the most out of your purchase. We love this calming grey and white living <strong>room</strong> with shiplap walls and lots of indoor plants. Perfect for an all-year round botanical aesthetic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>06 of 21 Gray Living Room Architecture David A. Land Keep the attention on interesting architectural elements by applying a neutral gray throughout the <strong>room</strong>. Stacked gray stone on the fireplace and a soft gray sofa let the large windows and soaring ceiling star in the space. Patterned throw pillows and contemporary artwork balance the <strong>room</strong>&rsquo;s use of color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>room</strong>s accent wall, large patterned area rug, furniture pillows and curtains provide plenty of bright <strong>blue</strong> to lighten and energize this contemporary living <strong>room</strong>. The accent wall is the main focal point and is painted in a loch <strong>blue</strong> and surrounded by a stucco color paint. The light color flooring and large open sun-<strong>room</strong> help provide additional light to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pink and grey where the color power couple for a moment back there, but we are loving this new, more grown up take on it. Mixing a pale, cooler grey with a lovely warm blush pink creates an almost neutral space, especially if paired with white walls and wooden furnishings as seen here. Add in a touch of muted light <strong>blue</strong> to bring out the cooler tones of the grey. Very chic. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We all love on-trend colorful sofas but sometimes we want to keep it simple and uncomplicated. That’s where a grey sofa really comes into its own. It suits all styles of living <strong>room</strong>, from country cottage to industrial to contemporary, and anything in between. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Both being jewel-like tones, navy <strong>blue</strong> and deep rich purples are a sumptuous combination that would be perfect if you want to create a cozy but sophisticated living <strong>room</strong> or bed<strong>room</strong>. Experiment with a deep aubergine on the walls and combine it with a statement piece of navy <strong>blue</strong> velvet furniture for a pairing that&rsquo;s moody and dramatic but also so elegant and timeless. Add in some golden accents for extra glamour. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Display your black and white posters in a collage, and mix in oak frames to elegantly add wood details to the grey decor. Oak frames paired with other accessories, such as wooden side tables, brown leather pillows, and green plants, make a living <strong>room</strong> more lively while contributing an elegant balance.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A fluffy navy rug would be a warm addition to the <strong>room</strong>, and could be matched with cushions and blankets on the bed. Or, use these elements to bring a pop of colour to contrast with the <strong>blue</strong> and grey, such as a muted yellow or botanical green. Anything that makes the <strong>room</strong> feel more snug will work a charm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tropical themes appreciate the generous use of <strong>blue</strong> in their designs. In this example, the striking use of azure in the bamboo-frame arm chair, the saxony carpet, and the subtle back wall behind the built-in bookshelves serve as a good complement to the overall feel of the space. The white built-in shelving uses the books and knick-knacks it stores as intelligent accent pieces that keep the <strong>room</strong> feeling personalized and interesting. The chaise lounge sofas used go well the distressed wood finish on the coffee table and the aforementioned exotic feel of the bamboo-framed lounge chair. Finally, the wide french windows used do well in giving us a view of the lush greenery found outside. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;There are plenty of complementary color options to choose from when it comes to navy. To create a contrast, look at colors such as browns, reds and oranges. Orange sits just next to yellow on the color wheel and works particularly well with navy as the bright tones of the orange make the dark <strong>blue</strong> appear even deeper.&rsquo; says the designer and head of creative at Swyft (opens in new tab), Kelly Collins. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to add some more grey tones to your living <strong>room</strong>, this is a really easy and effective way to do so. Rather than go all out painting a grey accent wall, instead learn how to paint window frames. See how in this space the two tones of grey help bring out the cooler tones of the <strong>blue</strong> and complements the pale wood of the floors and ceiling also. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Display black and white photo prints in gold frames, and add pink as an accent in the grey interior. A pink pouffe, pink pillows, or a throw makes the perfect accessory and lends a softer side to your living <strong>room</strong>.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A selection of favorite nautical living <strong>room</strong> decor and interior design ideas.Nautical designer living <strong>room</strong>s to inspire your own nautical living <strong>room</strong> decor. Deep <strong>blue</strong> hues, crisp whites, pops of red, elegant navy stripes, and lots of nautical theme motifs make up these beautiful living <strong>room</strong>s. From bold <strong>blue</strong> and white nautical living <strong>room</strong> design ideas to cozy nautical cottage living <strong>room</strong>s. And while <strong>blue</strong> and white is the most classic and popular nautical decor style, there are some designer interiors that show examples of neutral nautical living <strong>room</strong> designs using pastel <strong>blue</strong> and sandy beige. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Due to its connotations of wealth and luxury – historically it was the most expensive colour to produce - you’ll often see classic <strong>blue</strong> in bold, traditional interior schemes. But, don’t forget that this shade has its origins in nature, so it holds a firm place in boho design. It is the colour of the dark night sky, after all. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>13 of 21 Slate Gray Living Room Walls John Merkl These dark slate gray walls are anything but dreary, especially with the help of bright white trim and open shelves. A warm brown rug tops golden wood floors to prevent the small living <strong>room</strong> from feeling cold. Small hints of hot pink add modern color and foster a glam look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you can&rsquo;t decide between a beige <strong>room</strong> or a grey one, it&rsquo;s actually a perfect warm-toned color that combines the two hues. We love how it&rsquo;s been styled in this living <strong>room</strong> with splashes of sage green and pale mustard yellow. So what is the perfect greige shade? Well, we recommend Farrow and Ball (opens in new tab) Stony Ground. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The navy walls and hardwood floors of this living <strong>room</strong> design go exceedingly well with the olive green mid-century modern sofas and floral patterns seen all over the <strong>room</strong> – in the curtains of the french windows, in the throw cushions of the couches, and in the central floor rug used. The red leather tufted ottoman is the center piece of this living <strong>room</strong> design, its bold, rich velvet red contrasting with the greens and <strong>blue</strong>s of the rest of the space. This living <strong>room</strong>, with its selection of design elements and contrast, feels alive and stylish. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>14 of 21 Gray Living Room Accents Ryann Ford A dark gray sofa becomes the focal point of this largely white and tan space. Gold accents pick up on the undertones of a pale beige chair, and layered rugs add cozy comfort underfoot. Jewel-tone accents liven up the gray living <strong>room</strong> furniture. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This nautical themed living <strong>room</strong> looks great with its <strong>blue</strong> and white color palette. White wainscoting wraps around the <strong>room</strong> framing the french doors and looks harmonious with the white vaulted ceiling above. Rich hardwood flooring and wood framed furniture are elegant and helps promote the feeling of a coastal ambiance. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>10 of 21 Glamorous Gray Living Room Werner Straube Gray-green walls wrap this formal living <strong>room</strong> in an elegant, tranquil mood. Moldings on the fireplace wall are coated in the same color to add subtle dimension without the visual interruption of a contrasting color. Warm gray and beige tones appear on upholstered furniture, window treatments, and an area rug for a serene, tone-on-tone look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>08 of 21 Gray Living Room Upholstery Julie Soefer Photography A large comfortable sofa upholstered in a medium-gray fabric anchors a mostly white living <strong>room</strong>. Here, the couch&rsquo;s gray tones are echoed in the stone fireplace surround and a small side table, while a nubby brown rug and green pillows round out the nature-inspired color palette. This neutral works well with all colors and wood tones, making it a lovely alternative to beige. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Marianne from Dulux agrees. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s especially important to choose &lsquo;warm&rsquo; versions of grey to pair with navy, as combining two &lsquo;cool&rsquo; colours could easily make a <strong>room</strong> feel less cosy than you might have wished.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re looking to design with this well-loved color but feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, never fear. Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a versatile color that pairs with everything from classic white to deep bordeaux. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of our favorite hues to pair with navy, and some of them definitely aren&rsquo;t what you were expecting. Whether you opt for a traditional pairing or go for something unexpected and bold, navy <strong>blue</strong> comes through again and again. Which is probably why it&rsquo;s earned itself a spot in the pantheon to begin with. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Lilac and lavender have been gaining quite a bit of traction recently, with trend forecasters predicted it&rsquo;s likely to be the color of the year 2023. It&rsquo;s a very calming hue, that much like pink does need something darker to ground it and give it a less saccharine quality. Hence why it works so well with navy <strong>blue</strong>. It has the same cool undertones but adds a softness to the darker shade and you can find lilac shades that are so subtle, they almost just act like a neutral. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>12 of 21 Decorating with Shades of Gray Kim Cornelison This gray-and-white living <strong>room</strong> marries different shades of gray with varying undertones. The stone around the fireplace features purple undertones, while the light gray walls incorporate warm shades of beige. Gold accents and bright throw pillows warm up a charcoal sofa. A large fiddle-leaf fig plant adds a natural touch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Warm grey hues however will nicely complement navy and create a more comforting atmosphere. &lsquo;We recommend a warmer grey shade to avoid making your colour palette appear moody and negative&rsquo;, says Emily from Harris Brushes. &lsquo;Try something like Dulux (opens in new tab)’s Dieskau, Warm Pewter, or Timeless Grey, to leave <strong>room</strong> for your navy to work wonders.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;Colour blocking has become the new feature wall over the last couple of years, because it adds interest in a really simple way and all you need is some paint and some masking tape&rsquo;, says Aaron Markwell, Colour Expert at COAT (opens in new tab). &lsquo;Paint the ceiling and the top half of the wall the same light grey, to reduce visual noise in the <strong>room</strong>. Then paint the bottom half of the wall in your navy.&rsquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This traditional living <strong>room</strong> was tastefully and carefully designed to achieve a classic and sophisticated feel. The dark hues of the <strong>blue</strong> paint on the walls was an intelligent choice to keep the <strong>room</strong> feeling rightfully elegant; the whites of the leather English sofas, stone fireplace, cove ceiling, baseboards, and window frames keep the place from feeling too dark. The rich dark stain on the oak flooring and the subtle use of solid wood furniture also add to the warmth of the area. Lastly, the use of a glass coffee table and the contemporary glass chandelier further adds style to the <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to add a touch of luxury to a grey living <strong>room</strong>, velvet is the way to do it. The obvious choice is to go for a gorgeous grey velvet sofa, that will be the focus of your space. Opt for a deep charcoal – practical and pretty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We actually did had a recent debate over is grey still in style? And the overwhelming majority said yes. Thank god, because it&rsquo;s our personal fave color to decorate with and we think it works in every <strong>room</strong> of the home. There is however a trend towards much warmer greigey greys recently, so consider choosing a grey that has a more earthy undertone. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>05 of 21 Dark Gray Living Room Walls Tria Giovan Use gray to define your style and make personal collections stand out. Deep gray living <strong>room</strong> walls bring sophistication and warmth to this space. Here, the dark neutral provides the perfect backdrop for sculptural chairs, antique art, and vintage collectibles. The white ceiling and trim, as well as a large off-white area rug, brighten the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> and blush pink are the classic hues to choose for the most sophisticated, grown-up look. The shades just work so well to balance each other out. The muted warm rosy tones of blush pink counteract any of the cooler tones of the deep <strong>blue</strong> and the navy prevents the pink from looking too sweet and sickly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>02 of 21 Gray Living Room Furniture Dana Gallagher Although gray has a distinct presence in living <strong>room</strong> color schemes, it&rsquo;s still considered neutral. Consider applying gray living <strong>room</strong> ideas to big-ticket items, such as furniture and flooring, that aren&rsquo;t as easily or affordably changed. Versatile and timeless, gray works particularly well for investment pieces. In this space, the largest block of color comes from a graphite gray sofa, which is set off by deep <strong>blue</strong> accent chairs and patterned throw pillows. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘When bringing navy into the home I suggest mixing it with soft natural shades, such as Farrow & Ball’s Skimming Stone, with its clay-like hue, this is the perfect natural color to make navy pop. With dusty <strong>blue</strong>s set to be big in 2022, bring in on-trend touches of pale <strong>blue</strong> to harmonize the <strong>room</strong>, creating a serene and tranquil living space where navy stands proud.’ explains interior designer Juliette Thomas (opens in new tab). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>07 of 21 Natural Palettes with Gray Anthony Masterson Use nature as inspiration when working with grays. The color palette for this living <strong>room</strong> is drawn from a natural setting under a cloudy sky. Wispy gray walls and a teal-painted mantel give the space an ethereal effect. A natural woven rug, faux cowhide, and a leather sofa provide earth tones that help ground the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Want to add a little sophistication to your home’s decor without settling for a neutral color scheme? Try decorating with navy <strong>blue</strong>! The color adds drama and can stand up to bold colors. It also pairs beautifully with white, creating a nautical vibe. Here’s several inspiration photos for adding cool navy <strong>blue</strong> to any <strong>room</strong> in your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can simply add a navy and grey patterned quilt to your bedspread, or create a feature wall using wallpaper if you fancy something a little more elaborate. There are plenty of bed<strong>room</strong> wallpaper ideas to choose from, and the navy and grey tones will already have been combined for you perfectly. Or, choose wallpaper in one of the colours and paint the surrounding walls in the other colour for contrast. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can always warm up a grey living <strong>room</strong> with accessories too. Pick our warm wooden furniture, add in some cute rattan baskets, pick out cane lampshades too. Oh, and nice slubby linen cushions will help – check out H&M Home (opens in new tab) for our fave picks. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Remember&mldr; opting for <strong>blue</strong> in your living <strong>room</strong> doesn’t necessarily mean you have to commit to a dark, moody interior. Pair classic navy <strong>blue</strong> with brilliant white to achieve a light, nautical feel that’s worthy of a beautiful summer lake house in the Hamptons. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We&rsquo;re well-documented fans of designing in a <strong>blue</strong> color scheme. As much as we&rsquo;re partial to a bold pop of purple or a wash of muted green, there&rsquo;s something about the color <strong>blue</strong> that just has astounding versatility. And if we were to play favorites, we&rsquo;d have to say that navy <strong>blue</strong>—one of the most iconic shades ever—is the epitome of everything we love about this part of the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Whites are not the only colors that go well with the <strong>blue</strong> theme; browns are also good partners for azures and, in cases like this one, also give the <strong>room</strong> a dash of elegance and class. The wooden coffered ceiling and wood parquet flooring, as well as the wooden side tables and display shelves, keep the <strong>room</strong> feeling warm and stylish. The central stone fireplace coupled with the elegant faux-candle hung chandelier are good central focal points for the design; they keep the ambiance of the place feeling bright and sophisticated. The furniture pieces are also interesting to note; the dark brown leather loveseat and the bright red tufted lounge chairs are welcome additions to this kind of design style. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Navy <strong>blue</strong> is a popular color for sun <strong>room</strong>s. Of course, sun <strong>room</strong>s are used primarily during summer when we’re thinking of the beach and anything coastal. Use just a bit of navy <strong>blue</strong> for a cottage style, or use more for a sophisticated sun <strong>room</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Creative artistic paintings are smart design elements to any contemporary design. This living <strong>room</strong> piece employs amazing <strong>blue</strong>-themed abstract artworks to make the space feel sophisticated and alive. The contemporary furniture pieces only serve to heighten the artistic sense in the <strong>room</strong> – the strikingly bold modern chandelier, the ornately designed glass and metal side table, the contemporary dark wood framed arm chairs, and the geometric patterns on the rug all go well with the design. The navy <strong>blue</strong> accent wall, the dark <strong>blue</strong> satin throw pillows, and the off-white color of the back walls and wainscot, help tie it all together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps the easiest <strong>room</strong> in the house to try decorating with navy <strong>blue</strong> is the living <strong>room</strong>. Choose textiles in the cool hue, like slip covers, pillows, curtains, throws, or rugs. Of course, you can’t go wrong with timeless stripes in navy and white. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The large white sectional Lawson-style couch invites guests in with its comfortable and lounge-worthy design. The floor carpeting, granite-top coffee table, and the relaxing hue of light <strong>blue</strong> used on the walls further makes this space feel like the perfect <strong>room</strong> to relax in. The large french windows, white trimmings on the window frames and <strong>room</strong> threshold, and the white painted ceiling, all keep this living <strong>room</strong> design feeling bright, spacious, and welcoming. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Some of the most popular <strong>blue</strong> living <strong>room</strong> ideas come from playing with accent walls and multi-color <strong>room</strong>s. This traditional design for an intimate and cozy <strong>blue</strong> living <strong>room</strong> is a good example of using intricate black patterns to give some character to a space. The accent <strong>blue</strong> wall benefits from the black patterns on select throw pillows on the white sectional couch, the black floral pattern on the upholstered lounge chair, and the black stripes of the decor vases on the side table. The carpet flooring, french doors and windows, contemporary quarter-circle wood coffee table, and warm-lit ceiling fan give the <strong>room</strong> a steady mix of sophistication and intimacy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many people avoid combining <strong>blue</strong> and gray in their homes for fear the color combo will make their living space a bit cold and uninviting. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. Blue and gray can help you create a modern, unique space that’ll look just as comfy and inviting as any other. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wicker furniture goes extremely well with <strong>blue</strong> colored living <strong>room</strong>s, further cementing the navy motif that is commonly used for these spaces. The <strong>blue</strong> Lawson-style sofa complements the navy accent wall. The light gray carpet flooring, the large sliding doors, the tall windows that line up the accent wall – these all contribute to keeping the space feeling spacious and bright. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Homeware expert Joanna Ross agrees. &lsquo;Blue can have a positive effect on our mood before sleep as it connects us to a <strong>blue</strong> sky and the feeling of being in nature, which helps us feel more relaxed.&rsquo; A navy <strong>blue</strong> ceiling is the perfect way to bring forth this idea and create feelings of serenity and calm. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Grey living <strong>room</strong> ideas are just so classic. They suit any space and any style, which is precisely the reason why we have a whole gallery dedicated to them. Whether you are a lover of cool-toned greys that work amazingly in minimal homes or, if you&rsquo;re keen to embrace the dark side with dark grey and deep charcoal hues for a cozy and enveloping finish – you&rsquo;ll be able to find the perfect shade. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The white and <strong>blue</strong>-gray coffered ceiling is the main source of <strong>blue</strong>s in this example of living <strong>room</strong> interior design. Select design elements, such as the panel front door and the cantilever lounge chairs, also carry the <strong>blue</strong> motif with different hues of the said color. Overall, the contemporary design style of this living <strong>room</strong> is pleasantly offset by the warmth of the red oak floorboards, the white and black geometric-pattern rug, and the mid-century modern style couch. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>15 of 21 Modern Gray Living Room David Patterson This modern gray living <strong>room</strong> captures neutral hues across the black-and-white spectrum.

Turquoise chairs break up the neutrals, as does a colorful accent pillow on the sofa. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Crown moldings and door frames are used in practice to frame the walls and ceilings of a <strong>room</strong>. Using contrasting white frames on <strong>blue</strong> and gray painted walls achieves an affect that essentially keeps the <strong>room</strong> feeling usable and personal.

Bright accents provide the right amount of contrast and visual play, and a zebra-print rug adds a fun focal point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The gable roof ceiling has its wood planks painted a refreshing shade of navy <strong>blue</strong>. This in itself, coupled with the sun roof, achieves a bright modern feel to this living space. The large windows frame the lush landscaping found outside, further making the <strong>room</strong> feel open and bright. The furniture pieces – sleek and stylish mid-century modern armchairs, sofa and ottoman – keep the piece feeling clean and relaxing. The wood-burning fireplace, with its log supply kept stylishly exposed on shelves underneath, has a flat screen television mounted on top of it, making the back wall the center of entertainment attention in this space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Simply adding a wooden table or a console can elevate your <strong>room</strong> and add a touch of nature to it.
