Additionally, some toilets made this list of the best American Standard toilets because they stood out from alternative models due to extra features like slow-close toilet seats. - Source: Internet Generally, two-piece toilets are considered the easiest to install, even if they may take longer to put together. This is because it’s easier to work with the two separate pieces instead of trying to manage a heavy one-piece model. However, some people prefer one-piece toilets because once it’s in position, they don’t have to worry about attaching a second piece. Which of the two is truly easier really comes down to how you work. - Source: Internet Toilets are typically made with a single-flush or a dual-flush system. Single-flush toilets empty the entire water tank with every flush, while a dual-flush system has two flushing options. A dual-flush toilet will have two buttons for flushing: the first button releases less water to flush liquids down the toilet, while the second button empties the entire tank to flush solid waste. - Source: Internet Toilets may seem like an odd product to have additional features, but if you browse through American Standard toilets reviews or check the product descriptions, you can find a variety of extras. For instance, some American Standard toilets come with an EverClean coating toilet glaze that is intended to help keep the toilet clean by resisting stains. There is also a variety of classic American Standard toilet colors to help you coordinate with the rest of your bathroom. - Source: Internet The Cadet 3 flushing system increases the siphonic trapway to 2.13 inches and also increases the size of the flush valve to 3 inches to further improve flushing power. However, if your home is prone to clogs, consider investing in an American Standard mainstream toilet with a Champion 4 flushing system. This design features a 2.38-inch siphonic trapway and a 4-inch flushing valve for clog-free use. - Source: Internet Gravity-flow toilets are the most common type of toilets. These models can use up to 5 gallons of water per flush to force the contents of the toilet bowl into the drain. New models only use about 1.6 gallons per flush (GPF) in order to help conserve water, though this reduced GPF can result in limited flushing power. - Source: Internet The right height for a toilet depends on the user. Shorter individuals may benefit from a 15-inch-tall seat, while a user that is average height would likely prefer a toilet with a 17-inch seat. However, taller users typically feel more comfortable with a 19-inch toilet seat, so when you are deciding on a model for the home, it’s necessary to take the size of the users into consideration. - Source: Internet Installing a toilet isn’t overly complex, but it can be an intimidating job if you haven’t worked on plumbing systems before. Before purchasing a new toilet, measure the rough-in to determine whether you need a 10-inch, 12-inch, or 14-inch rough-in toilet. Double-check the measurement, making sure that you are measuring from the middle of the water outlet pipe to the wall, not the baseboards. - Source: Internet Toilets come in a number of different shapes and sizes. Depending on your preference, you can opt for an American Standard toilet with a rounded or elongated seat. Elongated toilet seats are better for bigger users because they provide more room from the back to the front of the bowl. The width of each type is about the same, with some differences between brands and models, but round toilet seats tend to be shorter. - Source: Internet There are several top toilet manufacturers, including Kohler, Toto, and American Standard. Toto is typically seen as the most innovative of the three, while Kohler makes a range of basic, affordable toilets.

To figure out if your toilet is a 10- or 12-inch rough-in, measure from the center of the capped bolts located on the sides of the toilet to the wall behind the toilet.
