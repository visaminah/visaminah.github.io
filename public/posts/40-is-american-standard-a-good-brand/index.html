American Standard subsequently changed its name to Trane on November 28, 2007.[1] Later in 2007, Ingersoll Rand bought Trane, acquiring the Trane and American Standard brand names. Ingersoll Rand has continued to produce HVAC equipment under both names. - Source: Internet They aim to create state-of-the-art and standard-challenging water fixtures to reduce the carbon footprint and negative ecological impact that every American Standard consumer creates daily.

Read on to learn more about the most trusted kitchen faucet brands. - Source: Internet The SpaLet® Bidet Toilet Seats \u0026 Toilets Collection is probably one of the brand’s biggest, shiniest gems. It makes such a statement, too – one that might just question toilet etiquette in America. Here’s why. - Source: Internet An essential factor that most users consider when purchasing any product is warranty. Essentially, the warranty assures you of the faith that a brand has in its products. Not just that, an extended warranty period also gives you reassurance and helps you avoid costly repairs and maintenance issues. - Source: Internet Choosing between standard one-piece and two-piece toilets is a common dilemma. While American Standard offers fantastic one-piece toilets, their installation may be slightly challenging. That said, one-piece toilets are far easier to clean and maintain in the long-run due to the absence of seams and gaps, which can foster bacteria, dust, grime, and germs. - Source: Internet With 20 years experience in the sanitary ware industry, the CEO of WEWE decided to design a kitchen faucet that is easy to install, even for DIY newbies. Overall, the company’s goal is to provide efficient kitchen faucets that make kitchen chores more pleasurable. The WEWE brand is registered in the U.S., and its products are manufactured in China. - Source: Internet The elongated shaped bowl and sitting height make it comfortable and standard rough-in size for easy installation.This toilet is environmentally friendly due to its 1.28 gallons per flush. It has a PowerWash rim that cleans the toilet all around. - Source: Internet Innovations from American Standard include selectronic technology, which allows users to turn the water on and off with a wave of the hand. The SelectFlo feature offers four distinct spray functions, and the Re-trax system facilitates smooth operation when pulling out or retracting the spray head. Ergonomic faucet designs comply with standards found in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for installation in handicap-accessible kitchens. - Source: Internet The brand traces its origins back to 1875 when the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company was established. In 1899, the company merged with several other manufacturers to form Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company. By 1929, the company had become the world’s largest producer of bathroom fixtures. - Source: Internet These toilets are especially beneficial for those with back pains or mobility issues. Sitting and getting up from them is far more accessible since they are at ‘chair height.’ Moreover, this toilet height is more convenient for long-term use. You will find these models in both brands, so there is no saying which one is more comfortable than the other. - Source: Internet It is interesting because there are some sources that give American Standard very high ratings, such as 8 or 9 out of 10, while harsher critics have given this brand much lower scores, as low as 1.5 out of 5. Another interesting fact here is that consumers appear to be much happier with American Standard products when they are professionally installed, as opposed to DIY. - Source: Internet Moments collection http://www.americanstandard-us.com/products/products.aspx?area=bath\u0026col=75\u0026cat=20,7,11,12,2,8,4,6,3,1 - Source: Internet While we can’t answer the question for you, we can help you choose the right one. In this guide, we will talk about the major differences between the brands and their top features. This will help you choose the right one for your needs. - Source: Internet But, relying merely on the marketing and advertisement of a brand isn’t wise. If you take a look at the customer reviews and ratings of both brands, you may be surprised to find American Standard featuring glowing reviews. Furthermore, most of its products boast a 4+ rating, which says a lot about the brand. - Source: Internet The standard for American toilets is a maximum of 1.6 GPF to conserve water. And to maintain this standard, many toilets are made to be dual flush toilets. Toilets with dual flush systems flush solids using 1.6 GPF and liquids using less than a gallon of water. - Source: Internet The Spectra+ Collection boasts of the brand’s best technological innovations when it comes to showering. A great example is their Spectra+ eTouch Shower Head, which has made it easy to go from one spray pattern to another using a remote control. Then, there the Spectra+ Duo Shower Head, which gives you a 2-in-1 shower experience. - Source: Internet The brand does not believe in settling with the status quo. They always strive to challenge themselves, even if they are already the best at what they do. You can see this resonate with each product they create, and every innovation they pioneer. - Source: Internet The first point we bring up is the construction material used to make each toilet (or sink, bathtub, and so on). Both brands use vitreous china featuring a coated ceramic surface. They are more or less similar in terms of their durability and ease of maintenance. - Source: Internet American Standard caters not just to homeowners, but also business owners. After all, water and bath fixtures are required virtually everywhere. The brand has been delivering water-efficient products for new homes and new buildings, as well as for renovating or remodeling efforts. - Source: Internet However, if you need to choose between the two, we may be able to help you.
