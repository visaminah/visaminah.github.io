Paintzen offers free, remote color consultations with our trained team of Project Advisors. Just a quick phone call can help you get some incredible ideas for your next interior or exterior painting project. They can also share some insights from our interior designer partners, and can offer guidance for specific rooms in your home, like bathrooms or kitchens. - Source: Internet Many major paint manufacturers have websites and apps designed to help you choose a paint color. Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and Behr all have websites with virtual design studios where you can try paint on in an uploaded photo of your space. It’s not a perfect system by any means, and the color and light settings on your computer monitor or mobile device will affect how you see the color. Still, virtual painting is a good way to narrow down your choices and help you decide between different looks. - Source: Internet Color Grab is a third-party app that identifies color in real time using your camera’s viewfinder. Once you’ve saved the color, you can view its profile, including the hex code, CMYK and RGB values. Color Grab can also match colors from photos in your phone’s library. The app is free and works with Android devices. - Source: Internet Light is one of the biggest factors affecting how color translates on your wall. In a home improvement store, you’re likely looking at a paint chip under a display lit by a strong fluorescent light – very different from the light in your home. Take that same paint chip home and it could look totally different. - Source: Internet 05 of 06 Shying Away From Bold Hues According to Woelfel, one of the biggest mistakes people make when choosing paint is simply being afraid to decorate with color. Especially when you’re selecting paint samples, don’t shy away from a bolder hue. After all, Pantone’s 2022 Color of the Year is a “courageous” shade of blue. - Source: Internet All this color picking is manageable if you’re painting a brand new or well-primed wall. Things get trickier when paint matching is your goal. Like clothes, car colors and photos hung in sunlight, paint colors also fade over time. Even if you know a wall’s original paint color, a new coat of paint might look off either because of color fading or loss of sheen. - Source: Internet Color inspiration is all around you. Match paint colors to items from your space or anything else that inspires you. Simply take a picture or upload one from your camera roll to find the closest Home Depot paint color. - Source: Internet Easily upload photos of your project to get started on the Paint My Place paint color app. Not affiliated with any one brand, this app allows you to try out paint, roof, and fence colors from a variety of different brands. If you’re looking for endless color options, the paid version offers more than 50,000 paint choices from 32 brands, including some of our favorites such as Benjamin Moore, Valspar, PPG, and Sherwin Williams. A variety of paint “tools” and the ability to modify opacity allow for a precise virtual painting experience. Save, email and share your color choices with friends, your interior designer, or a local painter or paint retailer. - Source: Internet Are you a free spirit, a dreamer, or a naturalist? Find the perfect paint color to suit your persona with the Sherwin-Williams Color ID app feature that pairs personality traits with a coordinating color palette. Match yourself to one of their descriptions to find your “Color ID” and a selection of shades to go with it. Choose a color from this tool or the company’s wide library of shades to create and save palettes. See a photo on Pinterest of a room shade you adore? Snap a screenshot and use this home painting app to color match it for you to an existing chip. - Source: Internet Picking the right paint can transform your space. Staring at rows of colors in your local home improvement store, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed with choices. It’s also easy to love a color in the store, but hate the way it turns out once it’s on your wall. If you’re trying to match an old color, it can get even more complicated. - Source: Internet Sherwin-Williams offers an app called ColorSnap Match, that allows you to upload an existing photo or take a new photo to find paint colors that match it. There’s also a virtual painting tool, and multiple ways to explore all the Sherwin-Williams paint collections. The app includes RGB color values for Sherwin-Williams paints, lists of coordinating colors for each paint, as well as the color strip you’d find them on in a hardware store. The app is free and works on iOS and Android devices. - Source: Internet 03 of 06 Placing Samples Right Next to Each Other While you should definitely sample multiple color options, avoid painting the samples right next to each other on the same wall, advises Patrick O’Donnell, International Brand Ambassador at Farrow \u0026 Ball. “They will distract each other (and you!) and make it harder to make a clear choice,” he says. “If you don’t want to paint the area directly, paint the length of a large sheet of lining paper, and it becomes a movable feast that you can see on different walls in the same room and at different times of the day!” - Source: Internet This paint color app allows you to test out different shades by uploading a snapshot of your room or exterior or by choosing from a large catalog of paintable rooms separated into easy-to-find categories. Browse shades or color match from your photos to get started. Save or discard palettes easily while working, and share your final choices by uploading your rendering to social networks. Though a desktop app, the site also offers a fairly seamless experience through a mobile browser on a phone or tablet. - Source: Internet Behr’s ColorSmart app boasts “designer-coordinated color combinations” that you can preview in room scenes and on exteriors. To help you find the perfect shade, it allows you to color match from an uploaded photo. Or, if you have a color in mind to trial, simply scan the barcode on the back of a Behr paint swatch or brochure. Want to get a friend’s opinion? Save and share color projects on your social networks. Once you’ve made a decision, the paint color app will help you locate The Home Depot store closest to you to make your purchase. - Source: Internet Our Digital Fan deck is not available at this time. We are working to resolve the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Please visit your local Cloverdale Paint branch for expert colour advice.A great way to get an impression of how your finished project will look, before you even pick up a brush! All you need to do is take a ‘before’ photo of the project, upload the photo to the web site and start painting! For best results, ensure the photograph is well lit, well focused and has good resolution. - Source: Internet Pro tip: Colors vary by undertones. So, if you’re looking for teal, for example, check the blue and green paint families. Neutrals are especially tricky, so look for your perfect color in the white, gray, brown and even red paint families. - Source: Internet In this way, you’ll quickly sort out the colors that don’t fit your criteria. And once you’ve found your color, the color visualizer will email you your color choice and the colorized room image. Then, you can share it with family and friends to get kudos for your excellent design taste. - Source: Internet Glidden’s paint color app opens with a “designer tip” before taking you to its main features, which include options to browse colors, find inspiration, color match, or take an interactive quiz. The color quiz helps you to select a palette with the option of having free paint swatches sent to your home to test in your space and lighting. As an added bonus, the app offers palettes inspired by different design styles ranging from mid-century modern to bohemian to glam. - Source: Internet Painting is one of those projects that entails a serious leap of faith. If you ask us, it’s near impossible to visualize an entire room (or the outside of your whole house, for that matter) just by looking at a two-by-two inch paint chip. Even then, when you finally decide on a color, you never really know what it looks like until it’s done and dry. By that point, you’re two layers in, and out gallons of paint plus wasted days of work. In the end, whether you like it or not, the color stays. - Source: Internet “Painting” the color onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “painted area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual paint swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - Source: Internet At $100, this color sensor isn’t exactly cheap, but it could make life a lot easier for anyone matching multiple paint colors. The pre-calibrated Nix Color Sensor Mini blocks out ambient light and uses a calibrated light source to read a surface’s color. The sensor then sends that reading to your phone via Bluetooth and the Nix Paints or Nix Digital app, where you can match colors to a dozen different paint brands in the US and Canada. - Source: Internet Introducing ColorSnap®, a new, integrated system of colors and tools that deliver the ultimate color-selection experience. Explore and find color in a totally new way with updated in-store and digital tools that help you every step of the way. Whether you’re at your neighborhood Sherwin-Williams store or in your living room, you’ll be amazed at how fast, seamless and simple color choice becomes with ColorSnap®. Only from Sherwin-Williams. - Source: Internet Picking paint colors and matching old paint isn’t as hard as it used to be with apps and devices like these. You can browse through thousands of paints from the comfort of your couch and throw them on your wall with the tap of a finger. Still, if you’re wondering how a color is going to look on your wall, the time-tested approach of a paint sample is a surefire way to find out. - Source: Internet Have you ever tried to pick a paint color online? Most of us find it a big enough challenge to do it with paint swatches in hand. But adding the online factor can make what should be a fun task seem darn near impossible. Thank goodness for technology, which has already figured this out for us. Here are some life-simplifying tools that’ll have you picking the right paint colors online, without the decorating drama. - Source: Internet Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over color swatches, the names of colors weren’t available to see (you’re going on small color swatch alone). Once you click on a color and it takes you to your chosen photo, there isn’t anyway to “undo” or “page back” if you don’t want that color. - Source: Internet Unlike the branded apps from paint manufacturers, third-party apps sense color without trying to sell you a specific paint. The downside is that there aren’t any branded paint colors to choose from as results. You’ll simply be able to identify the color value of the object or wall you’re scanning. Once you’ve got a color value, you can use that to find a matching paint color, likely by using the RGB value, as it is the most commonly used value in the paint industry. There are even online converters that will match color values to multiple paint brands. - Source: Internet 02 of 06 Not Considering the Furniture \u0026 Decor Avoid testing swatches in a completely empty room. Even if you just moved in or want to empty the room before you start painting, keeping some furniture and decor in the room as you select a paint color will ensure the hue works with the other colors in the space. “We always recommend painting a small board or piece of foam core and evaluating the color in different parts of the room and throughout the day,” says Andrea Magno, Director of Color Marketing and Development for Benjamin Moore. “This will enable you to see how the color looks with consideration of the light (both natural and artificial) and other surroundings (such as artwork, furniture, etc.), ensuring that you’ll love the color in all scenarios,” she explains. - Source: Internet This simple app allows you to snap a photo of your space and upload it quickly, then use a paint bucket to test out different color options. A color picker allows you to swap out shades easily or use multiple colors at once to try out an accent wall—a tape tool lets you draw a line to help prevent bleeding into the areas you don’t want to “paint.” When you’re happy with your design, a shopping cart icon directs you to Walmart to purchase Glidden brand paints and painting tools. - Source: Internet Behr’s ColorSmart app works much the same as the Sherwin-Williams app, with options to take new photos or upload existing ones. You can also view selected colors in generic scenes like kitchens or bathrooms. The free app works with both iOS and Android devices. - Source: Internet If you’re craving a new look for a room, changing up the wall color is an ideal high-impact, low-cost option (especially if you dust off your painting overalls and DIY the job). However, choosing the perfect shade can be a daunting process. When you can’t make it to the paint store and leave with your pockets stuffed with color swatches, there’s now a paint color app for that! Many apps, in fact, to make finding the right shade and even ordering paint online easier. - Source: Internet Browse colors right from your phone. Once you’ve found a color, see how it looks in a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom or exterior space. Plus view similar and coordinating paint colors. - Source: Internet To get started with this paint color app, upload a photo of the room or exterior you would like to paint or try the video visualizer, which uses your camera to show color options in real-time. A virtual fan deck allows you to scroll through Benjamin Moore’s collection of colors. If you are looking to step into your designer shoes, the company offers its ColorReader ($99) or ColorReader Pro ($249) expert grade color matching devices by Datacolor that can be purchased separately and synced up with the app. Users can place the ColorReader device on any flat surface to take a color measurement and the app will display the three closest paint color matches. For the DIYer or professional looking for speed and accuracy, these are great options. - Source: Internet Your paint’s finish or sheen also makes a difference in how color is perceived. A flat paint finish (like what you’ll find on most paint chips) won’t reflect as much light as a high-gloss sheen, so a flat finish tends to look a bit darker. Often, higher gloss finishes are good for bathrooms, kitchens and rooms that see more moisture. Flatter finishes work well in spaces like bedrooms and living rooms. - Source: Internet Australian company Palette released Pico in 2018. The $80 paint-matching device sequentially bursts red, green and blue light onto the surface you scan. It then shares those results via Bluetooth in your smartphone’s Pico app. Pico reports the RGB values and matching branded paint colors. - Source: Internet One of the highest-rated offerings, The Home Depot’s easy-to-use home painting app allows you to test out colors for your interior or exterior project. Scroll through popular colors and get suggestions for shades based on the mood you want to set in the room. A color match option allows you to match paint colors to items around you by uploading a photo from your camera roll. You can save favorites or share them with friends. Easily order your choices by purchasing through the app or finding a store location close by. - Source: Internet From siding and shingles to fences, decks, and outdoor furniture, choosing the perfect stain color can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking for a modern natural look or a vintage weathered gray, this paint color app can help you find the right finish for your outdoor wood projects. Launch the ProjectPro online tool from any browser or mobile device. - Source: Internet Here are some recommendations for locating information about try paint colors on your house online to get you started:\r- Research Colorsnap Visualizer-related information from credible sources.

After all, Pantone&rsquo;s 2022 Color of the Year is a &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; shade of blue. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>All this color picking is manageable if you&rsquo;re <strong>paint</strong>ing a brand new or well-primed wall. Things get trickier when <strong>paint</strong> matching is your goal. Like clothes, car <strong>colors</strong> and photos hung in sunlight, <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> also fade over time. Even if you know a wall&rsquo;s original <strong>paint</strong> color, a new coat of <strong>paint</strong> might look off either because of color fading or loss of sheen. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Color inspiration is all around you. Match <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> to items from your space or anything else that inspires you. Simply take a picture or upload one from your camera roll to find the closest Home Depot <strong>paint</strong> color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Easily upload photos of your project to get started on the Paint My Place <strong>paint</strong> color app. Not affiliated with any one brand, this app allows you to try out <strong>paint</strong>, roof, and fence <strong>colors</strong> from a variety of different brands. If you’re looking for endless color options, the paid version offers more than 50,000 <strong>paint</strong> choices from 32 brands, including some of our favorites such as Benjamin Moore, Valspar, PPG, and Sherwin Williams. A variety of <strong>paint</strong> “tools” and the ability to modify opacity allow for a precise virtual <strong>paint</strong>ing experience. Save, email and share your color choices with friends, your interior designer, or a local <strong>paint</strong>er or <strong>paint</strong> retailer. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Are you a free spirit, a dreamer, or a naturalist? Find the perfect <strong>paint</strong> color to suit your persona with the Sherwin-Williams Color ID app feature that pairs personality traits with a coordinating color palette. Match yourself to one of their descriptions to find your “Color ID” and a selection of shades to go with it. Choose a color from this tool or the company’s wide library of shades to create and save palettes. See a photo on Pinterest of a room shade you adore? Snap a screenshot and use this home <strong>paint</strong>ing app to color match it for you to an existing chip. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picking the right <strong>paint</strong> can transform your space. Staring at rows of <strong>colors</strong> in your local home improvement store, it&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed with choices. It&rsquo;s also easy to love a color in the store, but hate the way it turns out once it&rsquo;s on your wall. If you&rsquo;re trying to match an old color, it can get even more complicated. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Sherwin-Williams offers an app called ColorSnap Match, that allows you to upload an existing photo or take a new photo to find <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> that match it. There&rsquo;s also a virtual <strong>paint</strong>ing tool, and multiple ways to explore all the Sherwin-Williams <strong>paint</strong> collections. The app includes RGB color values for Sherwin-Williams <strong>paint</strong>s, lists of coordinating <strong>colors</strong> for each <strong>paint</strong>, as well as the color strip you&rsquo;d find them on in a hardware store. The app is free and works on iOS and Android devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>03 of 06 Placing Samples Right Next to Each Other While you should definitely sample multiple color options, avoid <strong>paint</strong>ing the samples right next to each other on the same wall, advises Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell, International Brand Ambassador at Farrow & Ball. &ldquo;They will distract each other (and you!) and make it harder to make a clear choice,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to <strong>paint</strong> the area directly, <strong>paint</strong> the length of a large sheet of lining paper, and it becomes a movable feast that you can see on different walls in the same room and at different times of the day!&rdquo; - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This <strong>paint</strong> color app allows you to test out different shades by uploading a snapshot of your room or exterior or by choosing from a large catalog of <strong>paint</strong>able rooms separated into easy-to-find categories. Browse shades or color match from your photos to get started. Save or discard palettes easily while working, and share your final choices by uploading your rendering to social networks. Though a desktop app, the site also offers a fairly seamless experience through a mobile browser on a phone or tablet. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr’s ColorSmart app boasts “designer-coordinated color combinations” that you can preview in room scenes and on exteriors. To help you find the perfect shade, it allows you to color match from an uploaded photo. Or, if you have a color in mind to trial, simply scan the barcode on the back of a Behr <strong>paint</strong> swatch or brochure. Want to get a friend’s opinion? Save and share color projects on your social networks. Once you’ve made a decision, the <strong>paint</strong> color app will help you locate The Home Depot store closest to you to make your purchase. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Our Digital Fan deck is not available at this time. We are working to resolve the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Please visit your local Cloverdale Paint branch for expert colour advice.A great way to get an impression of how your finished project will look, before you even pick up a brush! All you need to do is take a &lsquo;before&rsquo; photo of the project, upload the photo to the web site and start <strong>paint</strong>ing! For best results, ensure the photograph is well lit, well focused and has good resolution. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Pro tip: Colors vary by undertones. So, if you’re looking for teal, for example, check the blue and green <strong>paint</strong> families. Neutrals are especially tricky, so look for your perfect color in the white, gray, brown and even red <strong>paint</strong> families. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In this way, you’ll quickly sort out the <strong>colors</strong> that don’t fit your criteria. And once you’ve found your color, the color visualizer will email you your color choice and the colorized room image. Then, you can share it with family and friends to get kudos for your excellent design taste. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Glidden’s <strong>paint</strong> color app opens with a “designer tip” before taking you to its main features, which include options to browse <strong>colors</strong>, find inspiration, color match, or take an interactive quiz. The color quiz helps you to select a palette with the option of having free <strong>paint</strong> swatches sent to your home to test in your space and lighting. As an added bonus, the app offers palettes inspired by different design styles ranging from mid-century modern to bohemian to glam. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Painting is one of those projects that entails a serious leap of faith. If you ask us, it&rsquo;s near impossible to visualize an entire room (or the outside of your whole house, for that matter) just by looking at a two-by-two inch <strong>paint</strong> chip. Even then, when you finally decide on a color, you never really know what it looks like until it&rsquo;s done and dry. By that point, you&rsquo;re two layers in, and out gallons of <strong>paint</strong> plus wasted days of work. In the end, whether you like it or not, the color stays. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>“Painting” the color onto photo. The tech is ok. It does leave a white outer line around “<strong>paint</strong>ed area”, so that can be distracting. I also had an actual <strong>paint</strong> swatch on the wall, so it had a white line around that swatch too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>At $100, this color sensor isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap, but it could make life a lot easier for anyone matching multiple <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong>. The pre-calibrated Nix Color Sensor Mini blocks out ambient light and uses a calibrated light source to read a surface&rsquo;s color. The sensor then sends that reading to your phone via Bluetooth and the Nix Paints or Nix Digital app, where you can match <strong>colors</strong> to a dozen different <strong>paint</strong> brands in the US and Canada. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Introducing ColorSnap®, a new, integrated system of <strong>colors</strong> and tools that deliver the ultimate color-selection experience. Explore and find color in a totally new way with updated in-store and digital tools that help you every step of the way. Whether you’re at your neighborhood Sherwin-Williams store or in your living room, you’ll be amazed at how fast, seamless and simple color choice becomes with ColorSnap®. Only from Sherwin-Williams. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Picking <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> and matching old <strong>paint</strong> isn&rsquo;t as hard as it used to be with apps and devices like these. You can browse through thousands of <strong>paint</strong>s from the comfort of your couch and throw them on your wall with the tap of a finger. Still, if you&rsquo;re wondering how a color is going to look on your wall, the time-tested approach of a <strong>paint</strong> sample is a surefire way to find out. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Have you ever tried to pick a <strong>paint</strong> color online? Most of us find it a big enough challenge to do it with <strong>paint</strong> swatches in hand. But adding the online factor can make what should be a fun task seem darn near impossible. Thank goodness for technology, which has already figured this out for us. Here are some life-simplifying tools that’ll have you picking the right <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> online, without the decorating drama. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>Taking photos and allowing app to access certain photos worked fine. When looking over color swatches, the names of <strong>colors</strong> weren’t available to see (you’re going on small color swatch alone). Once you click on a color and it takes you to your chosen photo, there isn’t anyway to “undo” or “page back” if you don’t want that color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Unlike the branded apps from <strong>paint</strong> manufacturers, third-party apps sense color without trying to sell you a specific <strong>paint</strong>. The downside is that there aren&rsquo;t any branded <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> to choose from as results. You&rsquo;ll simply be able to identify the color value of the object or wall you&rsquo;re scanning. Once you&rsquo;ve got a color value, you can use that to find a matching <strong>paint</strong> color, likely by using the RGB value, as it is the most commonly used value in the <strong>paint</strong> industry. There are even online converters that will match color values to multiple <strong>paint</strong> brands. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>02 of 06 Not Considering the Furniture & Decor Avoid testing swatches in a completely empty room. Even if you just moved in or want to empty the room before you start <strong>paint</strong>ing, keeping some furniture and decor in the room as you select a <strong>paint</strong> color will ensure the hue works with the other <strong>colors</strong> in the space. &ldquo;We always recommend <strong>paint</strong>ing a small board or piece of foam core and evaluating the color in different parts of the room and throughout the day,&rdquo; says Andrea Magno, Director of Color Marketing and Development for Benjamin Moore. &ldquo;This will enable you to see how the color looks with consideration of the light (both natural and artificial) and other surroundings (such as artwork, furniture, etc.), ensuring that you&rsquo;ll love the color in all scenarios,&rdquo; she explains. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This simple app allows you to snap a photo of your space and upload it quickly, then use a <strong>paint</strong> bucket to test out different color options. A color picker allows you to swap out shades easily or use multiple <strong>colors</strong> at once to try out an accent wall—a tape tool lets you draw a line to help prevent bleeding into the areas you don’t want to “<strong>paint</strong>.” When you’re happy with your design, a shopping cart icon directs you to Walmart to purchase Glidden brand <strong>paint</strong>s and <strong>paint</strong>ing tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Behr&rsquo;s ColorSmart app works much the same as the Sherwin-Williams app, with options to take new photos or upload existing ones. You can also view selected <strong>colors</strong> in generic scenes like kitchens or bathrooms. The free app works with both iOS and Android devices. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re craving a new look for a room, changing up the wall color is an ideal high-impact, low-cost option (especially if you dust off your <strong>paint</strong>ing overalls and DIY the job). However, choosing the perfect shade can be a daunting process. When you can’t make it to the <strong>paint</strong> store and leave with your pockets stuffed with color swatches, there’s now a <strong>paint</strong> color app for that! Many apps, in fact, to make finding the right shade and even ordering <strong>paint</strong> online easier. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Browse <strong>colors</strong> right from your phone. Once you’ve found a color, see how it looks in a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom or exterior space. Plus view similar and coordinating <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To get started with this <strong>paint</strong> color app, upload a photo of the room or exterior you would like to <strong>paint</strong> or try the video visualizer, which uses your camera to show color options in real-time. A virtual fan deck allows you to scroll through Benjamin Moore’s collection of <strong>colors</strong>. If you are looking to step into your designer shoes, the company offers its ColorReader ($99) or ColorReader Pro ($249) expert grade color matching devices by Datacolor that can be purchased separately and synced up with the app. Users can place the ColorReader device on any flat surface to take a color measurement and the app will display the three closest <strong>paint</strong> color matches. For the DIYer or professional looking for speed and accuracy, these are great options. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your <strong>paint</strong>&rsquo;s finish or sheen also makes a difference in how color is perceived. A flat <strong>paint</strong> finish (like what you&rsquo;ll find on most <strong>paint</strong> chips) won&rsquo;t reflect as much light as a high-gloss sheen, so a flat finish tends to look a bit darker. Often, higher gloss finishes are good for bathrooms, kitchens and rooms that see more moisture. Flatter finishes work well in spaces like bedrooms and living rooms. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Australian company Palette released Pico in 2018. The $80 <strong>paint</strong>-matching device sequentially bursts red, green and blue light onto the surface you scan. It then shares those results via Bluetooth in your smartphone&rsquo;s Pico app. Pico reports the RGB values and matching branded <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the highest-rated offerings, The Home Depot’s easy-to-use home <strong>paint</strong>ing app allows you to test out <strong>colors</strong> for your interior or exterior project. Scroll through popular <strong>colors</strong> and get suggestions for shades based on the mood you want to set in the room. A color match option allows you to match <strong>paint</strong> <strong>colors</strong> to items around you by uploading a photo from your camera roll. You can save favorites or share them with friends. Easily order your choices by purchasing through the app or finding a store location close by. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From siding and shingles to fences, decks, and outdoor furniture, choosing the perfect stain color can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking for a modern natural look or a vintage weathered gray, this <strong>paint</strong> color app can help you find the right finish for your outdoor wood projects.
