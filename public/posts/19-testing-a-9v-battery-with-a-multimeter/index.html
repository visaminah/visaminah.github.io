Just use some common sense and have some understanding of the basic functions of a multimeter like measuring voltage and continuity which are the two most commonly used functions for this particular hobby. I took a battery for my multimeter (multimeter that was given to me for free), a very basic multimeter (this one: - Source: Internet I have seen multiple videos of how to test a microwave diode with a 9V battery using a multimeter. But, I don’t have a multimeter. However, I do have a 9V tester, which I think can be used. But, I want to make sure this is true before I think I have a good diode. - Source: Internet If the battery is new and still alive and full of life, the multimeter should read a voltage near the voltage rating of the battery. For example, if the battery is a 9-volt battery, such as what is shown above, it should read near 9V. that the ohmmeter reads should be close to the rated resistance of the resistor. Depending on the type of battery, it can be a little higher or lower, but regardless, it should be near the rated voltage. - Source: Internet Firstly take a multimeter and place it on the table. Also, bring in the battery you want to test. We will explain the process with a 9-volt battery for this guide. To correctly measure the voltage, turn your switch dial to DC voltage measurement. - Source: Internet If your multimeter is digital, it will require a small battery to operate. If it is analog, it does not need a battery to measure voltage. Some digital multimeters are autoranging. - Source: Internet We read 6.75V DC, which is about right. However, when trying to measure AC, this multimeter gives us a seemingly random number. (Maybe the DC voltage * 2 ?). - Source: Internet Testing AA, AAA, and 9v Batteries under load I realize this may sound like a stoopitly simple question, but I’ve searched Google and haven’t found a straight answer or schematic yet. So many of the threads go off on some tangent involving farads or henry’s or what not … I just want to test the frickin’ batteries that have been used in a handheld recorder. or guitar pedal, or what not, to find out if they’re still any good or should be relegated to the ‘flashlight until the light goes out’ or ‘ready for the landfill’ category. - Source: Internet A digital variant is easier to use and will always be the preferred choice, but again, it is not the only way to get the job done. There are a number of multimeters available in the market today that simulate a load to test the battery. These devices can be great additions to your tool collection. - Source: Internet https://i.imgur.com/rUDk2bE.jpg Helloi would like to ask if these battery:are the kind of battery used on any multimeter ?ok maybe there will be some multimeter with rechargeable batteryon mine is indicated that: - Source: Internet Testing batteries is a super useful skill and is one of the best ways to practice with your multimeter Testing batteries is a super useful skill and is one of the best ways to practice with your multimeter The first battery we’ll test is a new 1.5V alkaline. This one is a AAA but a AA, C or D cell will be the same voltage. Set the range to 2V DC. - Source: Internet But if you are confused about buying a multimeter because you do not know how to use it, here’s a guide that will provide the details. Read on to learn how to measure voltage levels for different types of cells. Also, we will tell you how to understand when to buy new batteries because they are running out of juice. - Source: Internet The process is the same as above. You would need to connect the probes to the battery terminals. Then proceed to check the reading on the multimeter display. - Source: Internet Technically the voltage is truly +170V to -170V in the US, which would make 120VAC we’re mentioning -\u003e 340Volts peak to peak. Since multimeters tend to show RMS voltages, its easier to just refer to it as 120VAC and remember that the peak postive and negative voltage are each ~1.5x the RMS voltage and the peak-to-peak is going to be ~3x as what the multimeter is displaying for sinusoidal/wall outlet waveforms! You can read all about peak to peak vs RMS voltages here AC voltage is great for power plants because its easy to transform AC voltages (using a transformer ) up to 50KVAC for long distance travel and then down to 240VAC or 120VAC to safely power your home.
