But unfortunately, we&rsquo;re not all that lucky. These thin brick panels from Floor and Decor look super real — but aren&rsquo;t nearly as expensive — and will add instant texture and old-world charm to your space. You can also get the look with peel and stick <strong>wall</strong>paper, too. No one needs to know it&rsquo;s not the real thing, right? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Rather than getting hung up on what to hang on your blank <strong>wall</strong>s, try leaning a few pieces. It&rsquo;s a modern approach to displaying art, a mirror, or even just an object that speaks to you, without messing up that brand-new dry<strong>wall</strong>. Plus, think of it as a pop-up installation that you&rsquo;ll change out from time to time when the mood hits you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>It&rsquo;s easy to create some visual interest with <strong>wall</strong> decor, but the creativity doesn&rsquo;t have to stop at just slapping some art on a <strong>wall</strong>. If you want to add a little extra flair consider an asymmetrical arrangement, like the one captured in this dining room by Martin Tessler. There are no hard and fast rules that say your artwork needs to be hung in a traditional or uniform fashion — the way you choose to install them can be a statement in and of itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don’t forget that <strong>wall</strong>s aren’t just for hanging paintings and photographs. We love using this vertical space for something functional, like shelving. A <strong>wall</strong>-mounted shelf with gilded brackets and crisp, white shelves takes design friendly <strong>wall</strong> storage to an elegant space that works in a powder room, home office, dressing area, or formal living room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Smart lighting can help, too. Living room <strong>wall</strong> lights cleverly placed can help split the space up into cosier zones. From hanging a pair of matching <strong>wall</strong> lights above a sofa to an adjustable lamp above an armchair, you can leave the overhead light on and have pooled areas of light to brighten up the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>From board and batten to shiplap, adding <strong>wall</strong> paneling is sometimes all you need to liven things up. The wood slat <strong>wall</strong> in a natural finish truly elevates the decor of this modern living room in a snap. Try the look out in your own space with the help of The Home Depot or retailers like this Etsy shop. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a large <strong>wall</strong> in your living room that’s needing&mldr; well, a bit of love, you’ve come to the right place. Having a big empty <strong>wall</strong> is much like a blank canvas. Unless you have a clear idea on the look you’re planning to create, knowing how to break up a large <strong>wall</strong> in a living room can almost be harder to achieve than decorating in a far smaller space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When moving into a new home, the most exciting part is decorating to make the space your very own. But one challenge that oftentimes leaves homeowners and renters alike stumped is what to do with all of the empty <strong>wall</strong>s. So much blank space can be a bit overwhelming, and frankly, original art can be a tad expensive. But <strong>wall</strong> decor isn&rsquo;t limited to fine art — there are many unexpected ways to deck out your space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to keep things simple, you might opt for a single accent <strong>wall</strong>. Or, for a more dramatic look, you could paint the entire room in a dark or bold colour. Whatever design you choose, make sure it complements the rest of your decor and creates the atmosphere you are going for. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of classic tongue and groove <strong>wall</strong> panelling ideas, vertical panelling is an excellent choice for large <strong>wall</strong>s as it adds instant depth, warmth and interest. It&rsquo;s easy to install, as it comes in wide sections that you just fix to the <strong>wall</strong> and it provides great acoustic warmth, too. Perfect if you don&rsquo;t want to disturb the neighbours (or don&rsquo;t want them to disturb you). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Clever living room paint ideas are becoming more popular, mainly because we&rsquo;re getting braver with our colour choices but also because they&rsquo;re super easy to achieve. Use architectural features wherever possible - existing arches, dado rails, picture rails - they can all be taken advantage of and painted in a contrasting shade to adjacent <strong>wall</strong>s. Don&rsquo;t have any rails or panelling? Try creating a visual version with a super neat horizontal line across your living room <strong>wall</strong> using FrogTape painting tape. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Already have panelling installed but want to give it a little more&mldr;oomph? Try your hard at colour drenching. While painting the entire <strong>wall</strong> and mouldings in one shade might look a little empty on a plain <strong>wall</strong>, it is a perfect match for a panelled <strong>wall</strong> as the shadows cast from the natural light add plenty of decorative beauty. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You deserve a dining room that shows off your personal taste. When designing this space, create a unique pop art instead of traditional <strong>wall</strong> decor. Opt for a 3D mural to get a realistic effect in your room. You can paint a graffiti-style mural in bright colours to get a fantastic look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have larger areas to <strong>fill</strong> up, there really are endless possibilities. And sometimes doing nothing can be a cool choice, too. From hanging an extra-large canvas to showcasing a picturesque mural, there are a lot of stylish solutions to consider. But where do you begin? Don&rsquo;t worry: Inspiration awaits. Below are 25 unique ideas that will help you <strong>fill</strong> all of the large, empty <strong>wall</strong>s in your luxurious pad. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>&lsquo;What about a living <strong>wall</strong>?&rsquo; asks Bethan Harwood from John Lewis. &lsquo;I love them in open-plan spaces that lead out to a balcony or garden. You can also work one into a shelving unit, which is slightly easier to upkeep. I’d keep the pots and background monochrome so the plants can be the feature.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Mirrors are perfect decorative pieces to hang on the <strong>wall</strong>s in a dining room. They add sparkle and shine to an already special place. They reflect the faces of the guests at the table, making for a festive atmosphere. And they brighten the room by amplifying the light from the windows, the chandelier, and candles. One large mirror (or a group of smaller ones clustered above the buffet) creates a natural focal point. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Kitchen designs are ideal for casual meals, but dining rooms are special areas in many houses for sharing meals with friends and family. Making your environment more attractive for those essential occasions might be crucial. Increasing your <strong>wall</strong> decor game is a lovely method to complete the task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Living rooms often have a lot of square-edged pieces – coffee tables, TV, media consoles, etc. so adding some round baskets to a <strong>wall</strong> breaks things up and adds texture and softness. I love the look of a grouping of different shaped baskets like {this set of 8 <strong>wall</strong> baskets}: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Are you looking for some inspiration when decorating your dining room <strong>wall</strong>s? Whether you want to create a formal or informal space, we have plenty of ideas. There are many ways to dress up your <strong>wall</strong>, from using artwork to adding textiles. So take a look at our suggestions and start creating the perfect dining room for your home! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Instead of hanging all of your art in the spirit of a gallery <strong>wall</strong>, follow the lead of Wall of Art and rest your cherished prints on a series of picture ledges instead. The display will add some unexpected dimension to what was once a giant blank <strong>wall</strong>. You can find different lengths and depths to suit your space perfectly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Looking for large <strong>wall</strong> decor ideas for a living room? With an expanse of blank <strong>wall</strong> staring back at you, it’s nearly impossible to dream up ways for a design solution. The possibilities are endless, and because of that, it’s difficult to narrow down your decorating options. We thought we’d suggest 10 gorgeous, new ideas to <strong>fill</strong> that blank <strong>wall</strong>! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to start small when it comes to your <strong>wall</strong> decor, why not consider a unique <strong>wall</strong> hanging? If you&rsquo;re feeling up for a challenge, we&rsquo;ve got a few DIY projects that might work perfectly. And just think of how proud you&rsquo;ll be of yourself for creating your own art. Instant bragging rights granted. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>While all-white <strong>wall</strong>s can feel light and bright, sometimes it can make blank spaces stand out a bit too much. One smart solution is to pick a bold color — like the vibrant shade of green that Dabito from Old Brand New chose for this living room— and paint your biggest <strong>wall</strong>. No need to add much more than that to make a striking style statement. And bonus: You can switch up the <strong>wall</strong> paint from time to time without too much hassle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Perhaps you are an art collector, or maybe you just found an extra-large painting at a flea market that you just had to bring home. An oversize piece like this one needs ample <strong>wall</strong> space to be displayed properly. The result is a one-of-a-kind focal point that&rsquo;s guaranteed to be a conversation starter. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re a bookworm like us, dedicate a large <strong>wall</strong> to your love of books and create your own personal library. From art tomes to the classics you read annually, rows and rows of books are a beautiful thing, as witnessed by the floor-to-ceiling built-ins in this bedroom. You can even arrange them by color or size to make the feature even more interesting. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Built-in shelving, like in this living space, can create a wonderful living room feature <strong>wall</strong> idea. It does require plenty of space to work well, which is why it&rsquo;s ideal for breaking up a large <strong>wall</strong>. It provides much needed extra space for storage and display, and looks extra effective especially if used to display a collection of house plants. And, as Bethan suggests, is a far easier take on the living <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The latest temporary <strong>wall</strong>papers can give you a designer look without a long-term commitment. Look for <strong>wall</strong>paper with pretty designs and colors for a chic style. For renters, temporary <strong>wall</strong>paper is a clever way to personalize your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you stick to a color scheme, it won&rsquo;t look overwhelming to cover an entire <strong>wall</strong> in different pieces of art. But don&rsquo;t just take our word for it, let this swanky kitchen belonging to Brady Tolbert show you how it&rsquo;s done. Check out Saatchi Art for black and white pieces in every size imaginable. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Function is super important, especially in a hardworking space like an entryway. But, we always want to bring in a little personality too. In this space we paired a impressionistic painting of boat with a set of <strong>wall</strong> hooks to create a pretty space that also works hard for you and your family! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Let&rsquo;s be real, most of us don&rsquo;t have enough space for all of our stuff. And if you have a busy household with kids, this is even more true. So a big empty <strong>wall</strong> can be a thing of beauty in terms of adding much-needed storage. Take this living room set up, the roomy floor-to-ceiling shelves provide the perfect place to store toys, books, and more so floor space isn&rsquo;t constantly inundated with things to trip over. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A framed print can add a touch of elegance to any dining room. Whether you choose a classic landscape or a modern abstract, a framed photograph can help to pull the space together and create a sense of cohesion. Hang the print at eye level for an instant focal point, or use it to <strong>fill</strong> an empty <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>A light grey or beige <strong>wall</strong> provides the perfect blank canvas, and you can then add interest with colourful artwork, curtains, or tableware. Using a neutral base also allows you to easily change up the look of the room by simply swapping out a few accessories. Add a large, graphic black and white print on the <strong>wall</strong> that beautifully punctuates the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Tapestries are a more affordable option for taking up a lot of <strong>wall</strong> space than say, an original painting that can break the bank. Plus, they&rsquo;ll add a welcome dose of texture to any room that needs some depth. This particular idea works beautifully in boho settings or even kids&rsquo; rooms, as proven here. Even better, you don&rsquo;t have to make a major commitment as they&rsquo;re easy to hang or take down whenever you want to switch things up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If the idea of hanging up a gallery <strong>wall</strong> of frames sounds intimidating, a large floating shelf across the majority of the <strong>wall</strong> or a bunch of small ones spread out can make displaying artwork a much simpler process. Not only do floating shelves add storage space for decorative items, but they also present the opportunity to easily switch out art and objects as you please. If you’re wondering how to <strong>fill</strong> <strong>wall</strong> space, this is an extremely simple, but effective way to decorate a large <strong>wall</strong> in the living room or a large blank <strong>wall</strong> behind the couch and other furnishings. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We love a good gallery <strong>wall</strong>, but printing large images can become costly and figuring out what goes well together can be a hassle for some. Wallpaper is helpful in quickly decorating an entire <strong>wall</strong>, but to do so can get expensive. If you are looking to hang up large pieces of art without breaking the bank, try cutting out samples of <strong>wall</strong>paper or your favorite wrapping paper from your local craft stores and discount stores and framing them. For an affordable price, you can <strong>fill</strong> empty <strong>wall</strong> space with multiple designs without anyone knowing it only cost you a few dollars! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I need to get this off my chest: I have, historically, never really known how to decorate those big, blank <strong>wall</strong>s that lurk around the corner in every home. As a design writer and former interior decorator, I feel like I should have had the answers for this long ago. What do you want from me, Wall?! How am I to adorn you? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When it comes to decorating, nothing beats a dramatic and striking monochromatic colour scheme for your dining room interiors. Use jet black <strong>wall</strong>s to serve as a backdrop for various white porcelain sculptural pieces. You can also opt for <strong>wall</strong> panelling to give a striking look to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Distressed mirrors can be used in various ways in the dining room. For example, you could use one as a centrepiece on your table or hang multiple ones on a feature <strong>wall</strong>. You could even use them as placemats. Consider featuring three tall, distressed mirrors on the dining room <strong>wall</strong>s to add a bit of sparkling drama. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best way to save money is to make the most of what you already have. If you are faced with a large blank <strong>wall</strong>, place your furniture in front of it. Placing a couch, bed, or dining chairs in front of a blank <strong>wall</strong> already helps you <strong>fill</strong> at least half of the <strong>wall</strong> space for no extra cost. Now, all that is left is to decorate the top half of the <strong>wall</strong>s with any of the budget-friendly options we mentioned. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You can use things you already own to spice up the <strong>wall</strong> decor of your dining room. Take space to the next level by covering an entire <strong>wall</strong> with a collection of prints and photos. Try keeping all the frames at eye level to add a massive dose of visual interest. You can add a small collection of hats, plates or woven baskets to create a crisp focal point to the room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>In case you were wondering, there are no rules that say you can&rsquo;t just leave your <strong>wall</strong>s blank. If your design style is minimalist and you like the look of clean white <strong>wall</strong>s, that&rsquo;s totally fine. For some of us, empty space is soothing and stylish, so paint those <strong>wall</strong>s a nice shade of white and enjoy them as they are. Fill the room with earthy colors and some of your favorite pieces of furniture, like a comfy couch or a pair of chairs, to complete the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The metal bookcase in this living room designed by Atelier Barda uses a lack of tchotchkes to its advantage, employing the blank, white <strong>wall</strong> as a clean backdrop for just a few plants and books. Sometimes less really is a whole lot more. Plus, this pared-down approach gives you the flexibility to mix things up and rotate your treasured pieces around at a moment&rsquo;s notice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Don&rsquo;t want to bother with hanging up a bunch of art? You could DIY your own <strong>wall</strong> mural à la this watercolor installation by Mr. Kate if you&rsquo;re ready to get in touch with your inner artist. If painting isn&rsquo;t really your forte, hire some professionals to do the work for you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>With wide <strong>wall</strong>s, special overhead lighting, and unblocked floor space that allows guests to get close to view the piece, a dining area is similar to an art gallery. It&rsquo;s an ideal place to hang art, paintings, collectible prints, or photographs that spark conversation. However, when deciding what to hang on dining room <strong>wall</strong>s, you should consider the atmosphere you want. For example, avoid anything with gory or provocative subject matter that could disrupt an enjoyable meal. And because you share this room with friends and guests, it is best to keep personal family snapshots out of this space as well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We totally won&rsquo;t judge if you decide not to DIY your own mural. This precious botanical <strong>wall</strong>paper from Rebel Walls is a darling choice for a nursery, but the idea can be used in any room of the house. And bonus: It is easy enough to install yourself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have white <strong>wall</strong>s in your dining room, make them pop by using a dramatic <strong>wall</strong> decor idea. The crisp white <strong>wall</strong>s will provide the perfect opportunity to display a bold graphic painting in your dining room. You can create colourful gallery art by installing giant paintings, framed prints and posters. You can also try to play with different textures and colours with the help of an abstract tapestry or textile fabric. It will give a vibrant artsy feel to the space. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I hope I have inspired you to go BIG and BOLD and finally show off those tall open <strong>wall</strong>s in your home! Many of the ideas I gave you can be combined together as well. Take a look at the last photo above. It has trim, contrasting paint, dramatic drapes, oversized art and even a oversized light fixture. The perfect example of how to balance those soaring ceilings and <strong>wall</strong>s. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Wallpaper is an elegant surface covering and will bring style to a dining room when used in its traditional manner. But it can be a good option of what to hang on dining room <strong>wall</strong>s for a decorative effect. You essentially create an eye-catching canvas by using molding strips to frame small sections of a special paper, such as one with an iridescent finish or with a bold, colorful pattern. Wall decals work similarly by putting small but impactful amounts of color and pattern on the <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>One of the BIGGEST mistakes that people make when decorating tall <strong>wall</strong>s is they get the scale all wrong. If the objects you are trying to hang on the large <strong>wall</strong> are too small, they will just get lost in the vast space and end up looking cluttered. BIG <strong>wall</strong>s require BIG, BOLD statement pieces to really show them off, and you will see that repeated in many of the examples I am going to show you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Take paint for instance. Painting a large <strong>wall</strong> in a living room in all one colour doesn’t do much to make the space look less huge, but using a variety of living room paint ideas in different ways can trick the eye into thinking it’s smaller than it is. The same goes for <strong>wall</strong>paper – one repetitive print on a large space can feel a little never ending. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Especially in a living room entryway, this large <strong>wall</strong> decor is a great idea to <strong>fill</strong> up some space. It’s an elegant focal point near a front door, but it’s also functional. Guests can lay their coats on the upholstered bench, and it’s a great spot to slip on your shoes before leaving the house. It’s also just so elegant! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>An oversized <strong>wall</strong> shouldn’t be thought of in isolation either. It should be the anchor that ties the room decor together. ‘When I see a room with one strong, dominant <strong>wall</strong>,’ agrees Bethan Harwood, Partner & Home Design Stylist at John Lewis & Partners (opens in new tab), ‘I’m itching to change up the other elements to balance it and bring the room together.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Adding dramatic sconces to an empty <strong>wall</strong> in an entryway or living room is a clever way to make a big impression. Take this modern pair spotted on Litfad — the sleek duo creates a whole mood in this contemporary space. Even if it&rsquo;s something simple, an interesting fixture will amp up the drama in any room. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>‘Try textured or metallic paint,&rsquo; suggests Justyna Korczynska, Crown (opens in new tab) Colour Consultant. &lsquo;They add interest by subtly catching the light. If you’ve architectural elements, work with them to create a feature, or think about panelling – the highlights and shadows created add another level to a painted feature <strong>wall</strong>.’ - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When <strong>fill</strong>ing a <strong>wall</strong> consider scale. Miles Redd’s Golightly Mirror has a grand scale, turning a plain expanse of <strong>wall</strong> into a dramatic focal point. One large piece keeps things clean and uncluttered but is still large enough to carry the entire <strong>wall</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Use a blank <strong>wall</strong> as a place to put your special finds or interests on display. Hang your instruments, show off a collection of mirrors you’ve found while antiquing, or finally display those vintage maps you’ve been hoarding over the years. If you’ve got something quirky in your life that you love, go ahead and let your freak flag fly. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Your modern dining room can go beyond traditional <strong>wall</strong> decor thanks to a floor-to-ceiling and built-in bookcase. Create a dynamic library to double as <strong>wall</strong> decor in your dining room. You can easily create a vibrant <strong>wall</strong> display by colour-blocking your library.
