But if you can&rsquo;t bear to part with the shade, use it strategically. A bold turquoise liner, like Sephora Collection Contour Eye Pencil in Summer Cruise helps accentuate bright <strong>blue</strong>s. And navy mascara, like Ciate Triple Shot Mascara in Midnight Blue, is a subtle way of bringing out <strong>blue</strong> tones in gray or greenish-<strong>blue</strong> eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When you are deciding what eyeshadow to wear today, think of pink. All shades of pink will complement the <strong>blue</strong> eyes perfectly! Yet depends on the occasion, but if you are opting for a more natural look, go for warm pink such as coral (pink with red hues can make you look tired a bit).

If you’ve never painted a room in this color scheme, it may be time to try it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Brown is the shade that goes well with all eye <strong>colors</strong>. Warm browns such as light earthy tones and espresso tones, compliment the <strong>blue</strong> eyes extremely well.

Its versatility makes it an excellent choice for decorative accessories, too. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As far as color schemes go, blush pink pairs well with navy, grey, and <strong>blue</strong>. Its lightness and softness help the color to enhance the feel of a room so that it can be paired with pastels, burgundy, or emerald. It also complements darker <strong>colors</strong>, such as green or <strong>blue</strong>. Its mellow, muted nature makes it ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, and hallways. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Answering to what color goes with light <strong>blue</strong> jeans. Generally, light and dark create a spark. There is no going wrong with playing with difference and creating a contrast.

If you get the right fit and pair it with a cool shirt, then you’ve got the perfect outfit for the day. Again, a little mistake, and you risk looking odd and funny. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>But you asked about <strong>blue</strong> eyes specifically, not just light-colored ones.

So! - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To choose a shirt color that will look great on you, you need to understand the color theory. It includes the <strong>colors</strong> that work and those that do not work. To understand <strong>colors</strong> better, you can use the color wheel. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The light-wash jeans do not complement most <strong>colors</strong> like the dark <strong>blue</strong> jeans.

Overall, jeans are the type of clothing that does go with almost everything. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>To complement and brighten up your <strong>blue</strong> eyes, use bronze eyeshadow. The nude, shimmery, earthy tones go well for <strong>blue</strong> eyes, and bronze is a mix of all. The natural and lovely look that you will achieve with bronze shadow, will require nothing else to your face. Your <strong>blue</strong> eyes will stand out and the bronze shadow, helped with the mascara, will blend great especially if you have tanned skin. Let this eyeshadow do its job. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The light <strong>blue</strong> jeans were quite popular in the ’80s. However, they have made an entry to modern times too. However, they need the right pairing, and the color is an essential aspect of dressing. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>I know that jeans are often treated like a neutral, but I usually try to choose tops and shoes that look good against all my dark <strong>blue</strong> jeans. Dark <strong>blue</strong> isn&rsquo;t a true neutral and it can make some <strong>colors</strong> really pop. What <strong>colors</strong> will work best? What about shoes? - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Golden pink copper shadow do magic for <strong>blue</strong> eyes!

Dark and bold green are recommended for brown eyes, however, this does not mean you should not use them. Shades like emerald green, soft green, turquoise, and even teal, can make your <strong>blue</strong> eyes look cute, beautiful, and gorgeous. Do not be surprised if your <strong>blue</strong> eyes start reflecting hues of green, this is very normal due to similarity in color. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>When choosing paint <strong>colors</strong>, orange and <strong>blue</strong> are good choices. They are close to being complementary <strong>colors</strong> but not exact opposites. There are no perfect <strong>colors</strong> that go with orange, but they do make a good pair. The color combination should follow color theory to give you the best results. Here are some tips to make your room pop with these <strong>colors</strong>: - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to set off your <strong>blue</strong> eyes and go for a mysterious look may be an exotic look. Flaming reds would be a WOW. Blue eyes with warm skin can take a strawberry blonde. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=3><li>WARM: Red hair or golden blonde or brown hair with reddish tone/highlights. Any skin tone, sometimes with freckles. Green, <strong>blue</strong>, brown or hazel eyes. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Beige hues look good on blonde hair that goes with <strong>blue</strong> eyes and dark skin of the cooler spectrum. You will get it more natural if leaving your roots a couple of shades lower to better match your complexion. When it comes to shades of brunette, mocha is our top pick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The maroon or wine color has got fewer lovers. Still, maroon or wine-colored shirts look good with light <strong>blue</strong> trousers. You might surprisingly love the combination. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want a sassy look, the skinny light <strong>blue</strong> jeans will have you looking great. You can pair the skinny jeans with boots and graphic tees. The style is ideal for a casual look or a party. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>We’re well aware that hair color, skin tone, and makeup techniques play a role in the intensity of your eye color. A touch of bold lipstick or a swipe of a striking eyeliner are surefire ways to play up your eye color, but today, we’re proving instead that the extra sparkle in your eye has everything to do with the <strong>colors</strong> of the clothing you wear. Whether you have a set of baby-<strong>blue</strong>, sparkly green, sharp hazel, or deep-brown blinkers, here are the basic color guidelines to making your eyes look the boldest and brightest they’ve ever been. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are so many tips out there on making your <strong>blue</strong> eyes stand out, and we have chosen the top 10 combinations for you. You have heard of the makeup rule that you can not wear <strong>blue</strong> shadow on <strong>blue</strong> eyes, but it certainly does not mean you won’t look good if you choose the right shade, so if you have darker eyes, use light <strong>blue</strong> and reverse. Take a look at the best <strong>colors</strong> for your eyes, and be sure whatever of them you choose, it would look great on you. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You read that right. Muscle tees, especially when black, complement the kindness of the light <strong>blue</strong> with its edgy contrast. Its juxtaposition is what makes the two stand out alone, together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you want to use this color in a bedroom, consider pairing it with a dark tone to add sophistication to the room. Deep teal, navy <strong>blue</strong>, or emerald green will add depth to the light pink. Pairing pink with a dark color adds maturity to the look and removes it from its childlike nature. And, of course, there are many shades of pink that go well together. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most common and safest bet for light <strong>blue</strong> jeans is canvas and sneaker shoes. You need to keep the shoe color light like the jeans. Pastel, white and black will work well. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Blue eyes and dark skin is a rather exotic combo (because of the genetic mutation, remember?), but the world is full of surprises. And if you are one of them, why not play it up by creating eye-catching contrasts? For example, opt for pastel hair <strong>colors</strong>, which will give a stunning frame around your face and make your beautiful iris even more distinct. For cool undertones, we like pastel purple, while for a balanced warmth, peachy pink can be recommended. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>blue</strong> and the orange color are direct opposite <strong>colors</strong>, and no matter how crazy it might sound, but the orange will create a very strong contrast that will make your <strong>blue</strong> eyes stand out. Any shades of orange will do the job just right. When using shadows with orange undertones, you might no require dark lipsticks and too much foundation. Go light and use neutral tones even for the lipstick. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The most common approach is combining cool with cool and warm with … well, you get the idea. Based on this, the best hair color for <strong>blue</strong> eyes and cool skin is ash blonde, followed by platinum and all kinds of silver shades. It makes perfect sense when a girl has a lot of pink in her skin – adding even more red with a warm hair color could make her look beet-faced. But an icy hue will be a game-changing hair color for <strong>blue</strong> eyes and light skin with some redness you wish to neutralize. And strawberry blonde is a nice choice for very pale skin with neutral undertones as it brings some healthy blush. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>So, pale-faced neutral girls can opt for a light auburn hair color to brighten up their complexion and make the <strong>blue</strong> eyes pop. Those who are on the warm-tone side are encouraged to rock copper tones, but they should avoid too much warmth that is capable of making them sallow-skinned. Cinnamon brown can be a nice middle ground with only a hint of coppery shine. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The purple eyeshadow will accurate the <strong>blue</strong> eyes. Try using lilac, striking violets, and royal purple shades to get an eye-catching look. Purple comes in various shades, however, using soft plum is ideal for <strong>blue</strong> eyes. These shadows require an eyeliner to complete the look, as well as enhancing the eyelashes with mascara. Blending few shades of purple is also a great option, or blending with sky <strong>blue</strong> like in the photo above. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=5><li>CLEAR: Dark medium brown to black hair. Very light or medium skin tone. Bright eye colours (green, <strong>blue</strong> or hazel) or dark brown (This one is MEEEE). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Grey is another cool shade that will make your <strong>blue</strong> eyes stand. For a minimal look opt for light grey shadow, or else you can use darker hues of grey with a metallic finish. This type of shadow can be used to achieve a smokey eye look too, enhancing the outer corner of your eyes. The <strong>blue</strong> eye will also appear like it has greyish pigments from the hues of the eyeshadow, adding cool tones to the eyes. Grey shades go even better with red hair women. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re looking for a color combination that works with grey and <strong>blue</strong>, navy is the perfect shade to use. It’s a highly versatile shade that complements various other <strong>colors</strong>. If you’re unsure what <strong>colors</strong> go well with navy, try pairing them with mustard yellow, bright pink, cherry red, or metallic gold. There are plenty of other ways to incorporate navy into your home design. You can also use both shades to accent a design. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol start=2><li>SOFT: Light to medium brown hair (or ‘mousy’ or ‘dishwater blonde’). Light to medium skin tone. Medium intensity eye colour like hazel, brown, <strong>blue</strong> or green. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Colored jeans are trickier to pull off, because you can only wear them with <strong>colors</strong> that go together with them. You can’t just slip on some red jeans with anything. You can only wear matching <strong>colors</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you’re unsure which <strong>colors</strong> go well with navy, consider adding a splash of Bordeaux to the room. This rich color can be added in small doses or as a paint color. Bordeaux and navy are complementary, so you can use them together without fear of crashing. Another color to consider using with navy is green. Its cool undertones go well with navy, and its warm undertones bring out the warmth of the <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Upward is a warm gray that pairs well with <strong>blue</strong>, gray, and white. Upward is also suitable for use in a monochromatic or contrasting theme. However, the color is more muted indoors, so if unsure of its suitability, try SW 6224 Mountain Air or SW High Reflectance White. Finally, choose an SW Upward color for the perfect bedroom scheme on the focal headboard wall. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The best <strong>colors</strong> for jeans are dark <strong>blue</strong>, light <strong>blue</strong>, grey, and black, because they go with almost everything. You can find jeans in other <strong>colors</strong>, like brown, maroon or white. But those <strong>colors</strong> work much better on chinos than on jeans. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Before you start thinking of what colour, firstly you must take into consideration your skin tone, checking the colour of your veins in your wrist is one way. If they are <strong>blue</strong>/purple, you have a cool undertone. Green, you have a warm undertone. Wear something white in a room with natural light, look in the mirror to see whether your skin looks golden (warm) or rosy cheeks (cool). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Upward (SW6239) is a light <strong>blue</strong> that mimics a tranquil haven. This shade is suitable for accent walls and can be used as a tint or full wall color. Its distinctive look and texture set it apart from lighter shades of <strong>blue</strong>. In-home lighting appears <strong>blue</strong>r and looks darker than in the image. Whether you decide to use this color, it will surely add a touch of serenity to your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The Color Man has created this palette of <strong>colors</strong> to fit any color scheme. The primary <strong>colors</strong> used in this scheme are Pigment Blue (#2F2D92), Denim Blue (#C4EAA), Gamboge (#E89611), Metallic Orange (#E36C14), and Philippine Gray. The <strong>colors</strong> in this scheme are easy to combine and match. If you have trouble finding the best color combinations, try searching the Combo Library. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The point is that when picking a hair color for fair skin and <strong>blue</strong> eyes, you need to understand your undertone in the first place and then decide on how you want to complement it. Basically, if having peach, yellow, or golden sparks in your complexion, you are a warm type. If pink, red, or <strong>blue</strong> shines through your skin, you are a cool girl. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The <strong>colors</strong> will surely wash you out. Instead, go for dark <strong>colors</strong> such as violet, dark red, or brown. If you have a darker skin tone, choose the opposite. Including too many dark <strong>colors</strong> will have you looking muddy. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>People with hazel eyes can experiment with hair colour if they wish. Hazel eyes have different flecks in them. Some have gold /brown, and some have grey, white or <strong>blue</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Following the basic rule, ash brown, chocolate brown, and burgundy are good hair <strong>colors</strong> to complement cool undertones, while chestnut and golden browns do the job for warm skin tones. Keep in mind that dark brown hair color can be too harsh on older ladies, but they can still rock the recommended shades. If you are a lady over 50 with fair skin and <strong>blue</strong> eyes, consider adding highlights around your face to soften the look. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>What was your first thought upon reading the heading? We bet you imagined those Scandinavian blondes with their light-colored eyes and complexion. And there is a scientific explanation behind it provided below. But blond shades are not a must for <strong>blue</strong>-eyed women with fair skin, and we are going to sort out every option you have. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have <strong>blue</strong> eyes and a fair skin tone, look out for the words&rsquo; cool&rsquo; or &lsquo;ash.&rsquo; Cool, intense browns, blondes, and blacks also, look good but keep away from red undertones. Subsequently, subtle highlights of honey or wheat will compliment your tones. When surrounded by ash or platinum blonde, your <strong>blue</strong> eyes will sparkle. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you are looking for a timeless color combination that works with every design style, navy <strong>blue</strong> and white are the way to go. Although navy and white can be simple and understated, they can elevate your home’s architectural style. If you’re considering painting your home navy <strong>blue</strong>, you should consider incorporating white trim and a red door. It’s not as dramatic as lemon yellow, but it is still a great choice. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You should note that contrast is crucial when it comes to <strong>colors</strong>. The first rule is that your cloth and skin color should never match. If your skin is pale or light complexion, do not wear yellow, white, pastels, etc. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The rule, <strong>blue</strong> eyes = <strong>blue</strong> eyeshadow, is true! Your eyes will look even <strong>blue</strong>r. Feel free and use any tones of <strong>blue</strong>, from light sky <strong>blue</strong>, navy, to dark <strong>blue</strong>.
