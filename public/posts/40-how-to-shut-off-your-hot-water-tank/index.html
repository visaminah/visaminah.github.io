Failure to follow the proper steps may result in damage to the internal elements of the water tank. There are only a handful of steps and they are easy to follow. - Source: Internet The water that enters your home through the main water line is pressurized, which allows it to travel against gravity through your pipes. This means that water can flow very quickly, whether from a faucet, hose or through a broken pipe in the case of an accident.

Modern water heaters with a thermocouple device will shut off the gas valve off if the temperature is too low, so holding the button will keep the gas flowing to the pilot light until the thermocouple is ready to regulate it itself. - Source: Internet Locate the Gas Meter Shut-Off Valve Once you have found the gas meter itself, it is time to locate its shut-off valve. Don’t worry: In most cases, this valve is directly next to the gas meter itself. Scan the immediate vicinity until you spot the valve. Look for a ball valve attached to a black iron pipe, though designs may vary. If you live in a multi-unit building, each unit should have its own shut-off valve. - Source: Internet Next, turn on a hot water tap connected to the system. This should flush out any air bubbles in the system and check there is water flowing through the water heater at the constant flow rate to operate the switch inside the heater that sends the power to the element . Run the taps for around 1 or 2 minutes and then turn off. - Source: Internet If you need to turn your water off for any reason, it’s always safer to turn your water heater off, too. While many water heaters will be fine for a while without a water supply, reduced water pressure or a low water level inside the tank could cause the heater’s components to overheat and burn. This could cause significant, expensive damage to your water heater. - Source: Internet You do not need to shut off your water heater if the water is off in most cases. However, in the unlikely case that you’ve had your water shut off for an extended period of time and used all the water in your water heater tank, then it is necessary to turn off the water heater. When in doubt, call a professional plumber. - Source: Internet If it is a gas water heater, go to your thermostat and switch the dial on top into the off position. If you have an electric water heater, switch off the corresponding circuit breaker Turn off your water by locating the water valve and turning it as far as you can clockwise. Locate the drain valve at the bottom of your water heater’s tank Attach a hose to the drain valve and run the other end of the hose to somewhere that hot water can safely be drained Open one of the hot water faucets in your home to let air into the tank so that the hot water can begin being drained Flip the handle of the relief valve so that it is sticking straight up. - Source: Internet Turn the temperature knob to the lowest settings. Turn the knob that has “On”, “Off” and “Pilot” markings to the “off” position. This should have cut the gas and turned off the pilot light. To confirm, remove the panel and view in the little window to see if the pilot light is out. It may take a bit as there may be still some gas in the line that will burn away. - Source: Internet If your home is connected to a city water line, then your water main can be identified by locating a ½” to 1½ ” pipeline near your water meter. You may or may not also see an emergency shut****off valve, which would cut off all water headed into your plumbing system. If your home is connected to a water well, your system may look slightly different, but the function is the same. - Source: Internet Next, you need to switch off the gas supply to the heater. If you have a lever, turn it so that it’s perpendicular to the supply line. If you have a knob, twist it clockwise until it won’t go any further. Finally, turn the air relief valve off to let air inside the tank. - Source: Internet If you have a gas water heater, turn the gas shut-off valve to OFF. If it’s an electric heater, turn the power switch to OFF, or turn your circuit breaker to the OFF position. If you’re not sure which kind you have, electric water heaters have AC power cables vs. a wide vent pipe on top. - Source: Internet Be sure there isn’t any gas present. Smell around for a rotten egg smell and make sure all the gas valves are off. This would include a gas line from the water heater and the Pilot knob setting to the “off” position. - Source: Internet There are some signs to look for regarding water heaters that every homeowner should be aware of.

Or, turn <strong>off</strong> the main water valve to your house. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>If you have a gas water heater, then you have a pilot light that is responsible for lighting the burner on a gas type water heater and you should know how to turn it <strong>off</strong> and on. There are a few reasons to turn <strong>off</strong> the pilot light on your water heater including the most common reasons: maintenance and vacancy. You might consider turning <strong>off</strong> the pilot light if you are leaving the house vacant for long periods of time. If you have a modern type water heater there are various features built in that may make it not necessary to turn of your pilot light such as “vacation” mode that will leave the light lit but cut of access to the gas to prevent a possible gas leak. However if you have an older type one, it’s important to know how a pilot light works to prevent igniting leaking gas as well as knowing how the water heater works to prevent turning on the heat to high and cause scalding burns. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have a combi boiler, you can turn <strong>off</strong> the hot water by turning <strong>off</strong> the mains stopcock. You can usually find the mains stopcock in the vicinity of the kitchen sink. It may be in the cupboard under the sink, or it may be on an adjacent pipe. Turning <strong>off</strong> mains stopcock will also <strong>shut</strong> <strong>off</strong> the water to every outlet in your home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn <strong>off</strong> the gas valve. You may have a lever or a knob along the gas line from the water heater. Turn the valve to turn the gas going to the water heater <strong>off</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Find the gas <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve and turn it to the <strong>off</strong> position. When you do this, wait five minutes and check if there is any smell of gas. If there is a smell of gas, make sure the system is turned <strong>off</strong> and call us (you may have a leak). - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>As with an electric instantaneous system, you need to first turn <strong>off</strong> the circuit breaker that supplies the power. This should be clearly labelled at the power supply board. This could be named Main Switch Hot Water or HWS and will be a larger circuit breaker than others due to this system needing 415 volts which is three phase power to operate. Some older buildings can also have just one 415 volt main switch independent of three fuse bases located close to the switch . If you’re not sure of your hot water power switches then call us for help . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are a couple of situations when you should consider turning your water heater <strong>off</strong>. If your main water supply is turned <strong>off</strong> for any reason, it&rsquo;s best to <strong>shut</strong> down the water heater as a precaution until the supply resumes. Continuing to run your water heater when the tank isn&rsquo;t full could cause heat damage to the internal components. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you have noticed a gas-like smell near your water heater, your home could be experiencing a gas leak. You should turn <strong>off</strong> the gas supply as soon as you can. Luckily, this process is simple and you can tackle it in 10 to 20 minutes by using just your hands and some simple household tools. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Furthermore, you&rsquo;ll have to wait for around an hour for the water heater to produce enough hot water for a bath or shower after you turn it back on, which is bad news if you&rsquo;re in a rush and don&rsquo;t leave enough time. Switching your water heater on also puts it under extra stress, which could cause it to malfunction if you do it again and again. However, there are some situations when you&rsquo;ll need to turn your water heater <strong>off</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you&rsquo;re concerned that you haven&rsquo;t turned your water heater <strong>off</strong> correctly, try turning on a faucet for a couple of minutes to ensure that the water runs cold. You can also try listening to the heater to check that it&rsquo;s silent. While a water heater should be reasonably quiet if it&rsquo;s in good working order, most make a low noise that will alert you if it’s still running. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Locate the Shut-Off Valve Have your flashlight or cell phone handy to help you locate the <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve. All gas appliances have a separate <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve, typically within a few feet of the device. To find the gas <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve on your water heater, look for a single handle, which you’ll usually find at the bottom of the unit. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Call 911 if You Suspect a Leak The danger of a gas leak cannot be overstated. If you smell gas, the best thing to do is to step away from your home, call 911 or your gas company’s emergency line, and follow their instructions. After you are given the go ahead to re-enter your space, you can follow the below steps to <strong>shut</strong> <strong>off</strong> the gas to your water heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Press down on the piezo ignitor striker. This could be a small button or look like the ignitor button on a grill. While pressing this button, you should be viewing the pilot window to ensure the pilot light is now lit. If it doesn’t light, press it again to try again, but be aware of how much time has passed between attempts to limit the amount of gas accumulating. If too much time has passed, release the red button and turn the pilot knob to <strong>off</strong> and wait for the gas to dissipate before trying again. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Using the cold water inlet control valve which is usually located at the bottom of the water heater if the storage tank is on ground level. This can be turned on by twisting the valve generally anti clockwise. With Solar systems that have tanks on the roof the valve is generally located up on the roof next to the storage tank . If you are not a person who is comfortable on roofs then do not attempt this . An alternative is to turn the water on or <strong>off</strong> at the water meter to the home instead . - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Many homeowners may not want to drain the water heater themselves if they are not experienced in these types of home repairs. If this is the case for you, you should stop after turning <strong>off</strong> the gas or electricity to your water heater and then call a professional plumber from FLAME Heating and Cooling at (888) 234-2340. Chances are, if you notice anything awry with your water heater, you will need a professional there to fix it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn Off the Gas Supply To turn <strong>off</strong> the gas, turn the valve clockwise. If the valve is stuck, you may need to lodge it loose with a wrench. If you can’t get the gas valve to turn or can’t find the gas valve, then you may need to turn <strong>off</strong> the gas to the whole house. Also, keep in mind that you may have to reignite the pilot light once the issue has been diagnosed and fixed. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turning <strong>off</strong> your water heater, like many other electrical appliances, can save you money each month on your bill. A small amount of heat escapes when the water heater is turned on, even though it’s well insulated. Typically, this loss of energy is about 10 percent of your bill. If you were to turn <strong>off</strong> your water heater, you could save that 10 percent and prevent additional energy loss. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are two steps in <strong>shut</strong>ting down an electric hot water tank. First you want to <strong>shut</strong> down the power. Never attempt any repair on an electric hot water heater without turning <strong>off</strong> the power. Even removing the inspection covers can be dangerous. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Electrical solar water heaters have either an electrical booster element or a gas booster . Whether there is gas or electricity supplying the hot water boosting this will need to be turned on . Some electrical boosters are on 24hr power supply and have a switch conveniently located inside the home that may also have an indicator light . In most situations the booster will be on an <strong>off</strong> peak tariff and the switch will be located at the meter board for the home. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This obviously means that even if you turn <strong>off</strong> the cold supply, the hot water cylinder will still be full of water. This is a safety precaution which prevents the immersion heaters or the boiler from trying to heat an empty cylinder. If you need to drain the hot water cylinder, take a look at the how-to guide for this task. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The other time you should always turn <strong>off</strong> a water heater is if it starts leaking. This is a sign of a faulty valve or could indicate that your heater is simply too old and needs replacing. A water leak from your heater could cause damage to your walls or floors, so turn it <strong>off</strong> until you can get support from a professional plumber. You&rsquo;ll also need to turn <strong>off</strong> an electric water heater before you flush it. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>This article primarily deals with <strong>shut</strong>ting down an electric water heater. Failure to follow the proper steps may result in damage to the internal elements of the water tank. There are only a handful of steps and they are easy to follow. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>The water that enters your home through the main water line is pressurized, which allows it to travel against gravity through your pipes. This means that water can flow very quickly, whether from a faucet, hose or through a broken pipe in the case of an accident. If you do have a broken pipe, it’s important to use your emergency <strong>shut****off</strong> valve to avoid heavy flooding. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Start by finding the breaker box for your home&rsquo;s electricity supply and turn <strong>off</strong> the line to your water heater. You can usually find the breaker box on an external wall. If you plan on flushing your water heater, now is a good time. Turn <strong>off</strong> the water supply valve, then switch <strong>off</strong> the air supply valve to allow the tank to fill with air. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Continue to hold down the button in step 5 for 30 to 60 seconds before slowly releasing it. Make sure the pilot light stays lit after releasing the button. Modern water heaters with a thermocouple device will <strong>shut</strong> <strong>off</strong> the gas valve <strong>off</strong> if the temperature is too low, so holding the button will keep the gas flowing to the pilot light until the thermocouple is ready to regulate it itself. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Locate the Gas Meter Shut-Off Valve Once you have found the gas meter itself, it is time to locate its <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve. Don’t worry: In most cases, this valve is directly next to the gas meter itself. Scan the immediate vicinity until you spot the valve. Look for a ball valve attached to a black iron pipe, though designs may vary. If you live in a multi-unit building, each unit should have its own <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, turn on a hot water tap connected to the system. This should flush out any air bubbles in the system and check there is water flowing through the water heater at the constant flow rate to operate the switch inside the heater that sends the power to the element . Run the taps for around 1 or 2 minutes and then turn <strong>off</strong>. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If you need to turn your water <strong>off</strong> for any reason, it&rsquo;s always safer to turn your water heater <strong>off</strong>, too. While many water heaters will be fine for a while without a water supply, reduced water pressure or a low water level inside the tank could cause the heater&rsquo;s components to overheat and burn. This could cause significant, expensive damage to your water heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>You do not need to <strong>shut</strong> <strong>off</strong> your water heater if the water is <strong>off</strong> in most cases. However, in the unlikely case that you’ve had your water <strong>shut</strong> <strong>off</strong> for an extended period of time and used all the water in your water heater tank, then it is necessary to turn <strong>off</strong> the water heater. When in doubt, call a professional plumber. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If it is a gas water heater, go to your thermostat and switch the dial on top into the <strong>off</strong> position. If you have an electric water heater, switch <strong>off</strong> the corresponding circuit breaker Turn <strong>off</strong> your water by locating the water valve and turning it as far as you can clockwise. Locate the drain valve at the bottom of your water heater’s tank Attach a hose to the drain valve and run the other end of the hose to somewhere that hot water can safely be drained Open one of the hot water faucets in your home to let air into the tank so that the hot water can begin being drained Flip the handle of the relief valve so that it is sticking straight up. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Turn the temperature knob to the lowest settings. Turn the knob that has “On”, “Off” and “Pilot” markings to the “<strong>off</strong>” position. This should have cut the gas and turned <strong>off</strong> the pilot light. To confirm, remove the panel and view in the little window to see if the pilot light is out. It may take a bit as there may be still some gas in the line that will burn away. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>If your home is connected to a city water line, then your water main can be identified by locating a ½” to 1½ ” pipeline near your water meter. You may or may not also see an emergency <strong>shut****off</strong> valve, which would cut <strong>off</strong> all water headed into your plumbing system. If your home is connected to a water well, your system may look slightly different, but the function is the same. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>Next, you need to switch <strong>off</strong> the gas supply to the heater. If you have a lever, turn it so that it&rsquo;s perpendicular to the supply line. If you have a knob, twist it clockwise until it won&rsquo;t go any further. Finally, turn the air relief valve <strong>off</strong> to let air inside the tank. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li><ol><li>If you have a gas water heater, turn the gas <strong>shut</strong>-<strong>off</strong> valve to OFF. If it’s an electric heater, turn the power switch to OFF, or turn your circuit breaker to the OFF position. If you’re not sure which kind you have, electric water heaters have AC power cables vs. a wide vent pipe on top. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ol></li><li>Be sure there isn’t any gas present. Smell around for a rotten egg smell and make sure all the gas valves are <strong>off</strong>. This would include a gas line from the water heater and the Pilot knob setting to the “<strong>off</strong>” position. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li><li>There are some signs to look for regarding water heaters that every homeowner should be aware of. When you notice these signs, the first thing you should do is turn <strong>off</strong> your water heater. If your water heater is making strange noises, overheating, or doing anything out of the ordinary, or if you smell gas anywhere in the house, these are all signs that you should turn it <strong>off</strong>. The longer you allow it, the more likely it is that the problem will get worse. The next step is to actually turn <strong>off</strong> the water heater. - <cite>Source: Internet</cite></li></ul><img loading=lazy src=https://www.askmehelpdesk.com/attachments/plumbing/36413d1307276002-hot-water-drain-valve-replacement-100_3723.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="How To Shut Off Your Hot Water Tank - how to shut off your hot water tank">
